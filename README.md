## R1 Introduction

This README acts as **walkthrough** guidance of the order of analyses for
Fellows Yates, J.A. _et al._ (2020) XXXX. It acts as a **practical methods**
supplement as well as for displaying additional **figures** only. Justification
and discussion of figures and results are sparsely described, and the main
publication should be referred to for scientific interpretation and context.

The repository contains additional data files, R notebooks, scripts and
commands where a program was initiated directly from the command line, as well
as _some_ additional results.

The following objects that are referred to in the supplementary information of
the paper can be found here:

- External Data Repository Section RXX (in this README)
- External Data Repository Figure RXX (in this README and under `05-images/`.)
- External Data Repository Table RXX (in this README)
- External Data Repository File RXX  (in this README and under
`06-additional_data_files/`.)

Code can be found under the directory `02-scripts.backup`, 'raw'
analysis results can be seen under `04-analysis`. 'Cleaned-up'/summary analysis
results and metadata files can be seen under `00-documentation`. Figures
displayed within this README are stored under `05-images`. Additional data
files for fast access/referral in the main publication can be seen under
`06-additional_data_files`.

> `01-data` and `03-preprocessing` only contains empty directories as these
contain very large sequencing files that cannot be uploaded to this repository.
They are kept here so if reproducing analysis, paths in scripts do not need to
be modified. Raw data can be found on the ENA under project accession ID:
PRJEB34569.

In more detail, the general structure of this project is typically as follows
(although variants will occur):

## R2 Resources

Here is a list of programs and databases that will be used in this analysis
and that you should have ready installed/downloaded prior carrying out the
analysis. Note that the download and set up of the databases are described
below.

This analysis was performed on a server running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and a SLURM
submission scheduler. Some scripts or commands may heavily refer to SLURM,
however these are directly related to our system. As far as we can, we have
removed SLURM commands and/or MPI-SHH specific paths or parameters, but you
should always check this for each command and script.

## R3 Software Paths

Some scripts used in this project use variables stored a central profile called
`02-scripts.backup/000-analysis_profile`. These variables indicate the location
of certain programs in your servers file-system. The scripts loading the
profile will therefore look for and use the program stored in the variable.

You will need to [replace the paths](#r45-database-analysis-profile) stored there to where each tool is stored
on your personal server, I have replaced our central storage to `<YOUR_PATH>`,
however you will need to check each path correctly.

> Note: not all scripts use the 'profile', so please check each one before running

For direct commands (i.e. not used in a script), the path will either
be defined in the command block or assumed already in your `$PATH`.

### R4.1 MALT Databases

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R4.1.1 nt

The MALT nt databases was downloaded and generated as follows.

```bash

## MALT indexed NT database
mkdir -p 01-data/databases/malt/raw 01-data/databases/malt/indexed
cd 01-data/databases/malt/raw

### Download nucleotide database fasta and md5sum file into a database directory
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz .
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz.md5 .

### Generate the md5sum of the downloaded file, and comapre with contents of
### the NCBI .md5 version
md5sum nt.gz
cat nt.gz.md5

### Download into a different directory the accession to taxonomy mapping file

#### R4.1.2 Custom RefSeq

For the custom NCBI Genome RefSeq database containing bacterial and archaea
assemblies at scaffold, chromosome and complete levels - we follow the
R notebook  here: `02-scripts.backup/099-refseq_genomes_bacteria_archaea_homo_complete_chromosome_scaffold_walkthrough_20181029.Rmd`.
A corresponding list of genomes selected for use in this database can be seen
in in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R10.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R4.2 AADDER Database

To build the `aadder` database for functional analysis - based on the custom
RefSeq MALT database above - we run the command
`01-data/027-aadder_build_refseqCGS_bacarch_sbatch_script_20181104.sh`. This
calls the `adder-build` command as provided in the MEGAN install directory's
`tools` folder. Note we have to change the `MEGAN.vmoptions` to have a large
enough memory allocation in the MEAN install directory.

### R4.3 BWA Indexing

The SILVA reference database, and all single genomes (HG19, bacterial etc.) were
indexed as follows - with the SILVA database FASTA file as an example.

```bash
BWA=<PATH_TO>/bwa
SAMTOOLS=<PATH_TO>/samtools
PICARDTOOLS=<PATH_TO>/picard

mkdir $DBDIR/silva
cd !$

wget http://ftp.arb-silva.de/release_128/Exports/SILVA_128_SSURef_Nr99_tax_silva_trunc.fasta.gz

## R5 Data Acquisition

All raw FASTQ files should be downloaded to sample specific directories in `01-data/public_data/raw`.

General laboratory and sequencing and meta information about all newly generated
libraries for this study can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files/` under Data R01 and Data R02.

The same information but for controls can be seen in Data R03.

### R5.1 Additional Individuals

In addition to the samples sequenced in this study (or generated by our
group, but previously published in the case of JAE), we downloaded the shotgun
sequenced individuals from Weyrich et al. 2017 (Nature).

For this, I downloaded the 'processed' files from the OAGR database, as the
original data had barcodes, and they already had used AdapterRemoval,
as done here.

The list of files and hard links can be seen in the documentation under
`00-documentation.backup/99-public_data-Weyrich_Neanderthals.txt`.

I downloaded each file with `wget`, renaming with the file as listed in the
OAGR website, concatenated multi-file samples if required (i.e. ElSidron1) then
renamed to the EAGER standard.

An example:

```bash
cd 01-data/public_data/
mkdir ElSidron1

wget https://www.oagr.org.au/api/v1/dataset_file/3086/download
rename s/download/2NoAdapt_ELSIDRON1L7_lTACTG_rCTCGA_R1R2_Collapsed.fastq.gz/ download
wget https://www.oagr.org.au/api/v1/dataset_file/3109/download
rename s/download/2NoAdapt_ELSIDRON1L7_lTACTG_rCTCGA_R1R2_Collapsed_Truncated.fastq.gz/ download

cat *fastq.gz > ElSidron1_S0_L000_R1_000.fastq.merged.fq.gz

## If no concatenation required
# mv 2NoAdapt_CHIMP_150519_lACGTG_rATTGA_R1R2_Collapsed.fastq.gz Chimp.150519_S0_L000_R1_000.fastq.merged.fq.gz

```

The final merged individual fastq files were moved to individual directories in
`/01-data/public_data/prepped`.

The just renamed files were then symlinked into the folder above.

### R5.2 Comparative Sources

In addition to ancient and calculus samples, we also require comparative data
from different sources of microbiomes (e.g. soil, skin, gut etc.).

> Note that the bone 'environmental' sample comparative samples were previously
> published, but re-sequenced for this study. The new sequencing files used in
> this study can also be found in the ENA repository PRJEB34569 alongside all
> new calculus data.

Comparative source files were selected based on the following criteria:

- Had to be shotgun metagenomes
- Have had no modification or treatment made to DNA selection or host (e.g.
  no pesticide, as far as could be determined)
- Must have been generated on an Illumina platform
- Must have more than 10 million reads
- Must have yield than 1000 16S rRNA reads in the shotgun data (detected
  during analysis - see [QIIME section](#r821-16s-extraction))

In addition, the Human Microbiome Project gut and plaque samples had the
additional criteria of:

- Each must be from unique individuals
- Aim for approximately 50/50 male and female where possible

The files were downloaded from the NCBI SRA and EBI ENA
databases. A list of these libraries can be seen either in
`06-additional_data_files` under R04, or in the 'mapping' file
`00-documentation.backup/02-microbiome_calculus-deep_evolution-individualscontrolssources_metadata.tsv`.

Metadata on the HMP samples can be seen in
`00-documentation/99-sourcemetadata-hmp_SraRunTable_allRuns.tsv`, with
samples selected for each source type coming from unique individuals, as
inferred by the hmp_subject_id column. Metadata for the other datasets can be
seen in the `00-documentation/99-sourcemetadata-*` files

A file containing the ERR and SRR numbers of each library on each line was
given to the scripts `001-SRA_download_script.sh` and `002-ERR_download_script.sh`.

Some HMP project samples were not available directly from the SRA FTP server,
in which case these were directly pulled using either `prefetch -v`, which is
a similar command as in the `001-SRA_download_script.sh` file, but without
the `wget` step.

```bash
SRATOOLKIT=/projects1/tools/sratoolkit/2.8.0/sratoolkit.2.8.0-ubuntu64/bin

"$SRATOOKIT"/prefetch -v SRR514306
"$SRATOOKIT"/fastq-dump -F --split-files --readids /projects1/clusterhomes/fellows/ncbi/public/sra/SRR514306.sra --gzip --outdir .
```

These were then renamed using

```bash
cd 01-data/public_data/raw/
rename s/_1.fastq.gz/_S0_L001_R1_000.fastq.gz/ */*.fastq.gz
rename s/_2.fastq.gz/_S0_L001_R2_000.fastq.gz/ */*.fastq.gz

```

The final fastq files were then placed symlinked to individual directories in
`01-data/public_data/prepped`

For the sediment data from Slon et al. 2017, I also resorted to
downloading the FASTQ files directly. However, unfortunately, the uploaded
data was actually not 'raw' but the already merged data from the Slon 2017 paper.
We downloaded the FASTQ data anyway and did a modified pre-processing.

I did this with the following command, and utilising the file generated from
 the parsing script of the two metadata files which is stored here
 `02-scripts.backup/99-Slon2017_DataFinderScript.R`.

```bash
cat 00-documentation.backup/99-Slon2017_AccessionsToDownload_2.tsv | while read LINE; do
  mkdir 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev) && \
  wget $(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1) -P 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/ && \
  wget $(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f2) -P 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/ && \
  wget $(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f3) -P 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/ && \
  rename s/.fastq.gz/_S0_L001_R1_000.merged.fastq.gz/ \
  01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev).fastq.gz && \
  rename s/_1.fastq.gz/_S0_L001_R1_000.fastq.gz/ 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/*.fastq.gz && \
  rename s/_2.fastq.gz/_S0_L001_R2_000.fastq.gz/ 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/*.fastq.gz
done

```

To complete standardisation of this data, we combined singleton files.

```bash
cat 00-documentation.backup/99-Slon2017_AccessionsToDownload_2.tsv | while read LINE; do
  mkdir 03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/input/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/ && \
  cat 01-data/raw_data/screening/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/*.fastq.gz >> \
  03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/input/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)/$(echo $LINE | cut -d ';' -f1 | rev | cut -d/ -f 2 | rev)_S0_L001_R1_000.merged.fq.gz
done
```

The final merged individual fastq files were moved to individual directories in
`01-data/public_data/prepped`

## R6 Data Preprocessing

Now downloaded, we started preprocessing by performing a sequencing quality
check, merged any of the PE data (as well as trimming low quality bases),
removed any DNA that maps to the human genome (but preserving the statistics)
and extracted all-non human DNA for downstream processing.

We performed this in two different ways. When this project first started our
local build of EAGER was broken, so I made our own script version(s)
(`02-scripts.backup/003-preprocessing_human_filtering.sh`, and
`02-scripts.backup/004-preprocessing_human_filtering_premerged.sh`) utilising
the same commands and tool versions as run by EAGER. Once EAGER was fixed, we
returned to using to this as it was more robust. The only addition to the script
version was `samtools fastq` to convert unmapped reads (i.e. non-human reads,
used for metagenomic screening) to FASTQ.

The output of both methods of preprocessing was stored in `03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering`.

### R6.1 Preprocessing

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R6.1.1 Script Version

Below I provide a loop that made sure to run the script(s) on libraries we had not
 already run based on what was already present in the output
directory. All we needed was to change the paths in the variables `INDIR` and
`OUTDIR`.

> If you need to increase the number of cores of memory, you can

You will need to check if these 'manual' scripts are working correctly
manually, as I didn't have time to in-built checks. We verified this by checking
all the fields in the output of the statistics script
([see here](r622-statistics)) was filled with numbers.

An example of the loop using with 'premerged' script is as follow (remove the
`_premerged` section of the script name to run for 'raw' FASTQs)

```bash
## Cycle through INDIR corresponding to each type of data (paired/single, hiseq/nextseq, pre-merged etc.)
INDIR=03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/input/hiseq_single
OUTDIR=03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/output
SCRIPTS=02-scripts.backup

for LIBDIR in "$INDIR"/*/; do
  LIBNAME=$(echo "$LIBDIR" | rev | cut -d/ -f2 | rev)
  if [ -d "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME" ]; then
    printf "\n $LIBNAME already Processed \n\n"
  else
    mkdir "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME"
    $SCRIPTS/03-preprocessing_human_filtering_premerged.sh $OUTDIR/$LIBNAME $LIBDIR $LIBNAME
    sleep 1
done
```

#### R6.1.2 EAGER Version

For the Slon et al. 2017 and Weyrich et al. 2017 datasets, we ran EAGER without
AdapterRemoval as the ENA/OAGR uploaded data was already trimmed and merged.

For the VLC/ARS/DLV/PLV/RIG/OFN samples, and some of the blanks and deep
sequenced samples that came later, I ran the same as below, but with FastQC and
AdapterRemoval turned on with default settings.

```text
Organism: Human
Age: Ancient
Treated Data: non-UDG [Deep : UDG]
Pairment: Single End (VLC/EXB/LIB - Paired End)
Input is already concatenated (skip merging): Y (VLC/EXB/LIB - N)
Concatenate Lanewise together: N (VLC -Y, EXB/LIB - N)

  Qualityfilter: 0
  Filter unmapped: Off
  Extract Mapped/Unmapped: On
Remove Duplicates: DeDup
  Treat all reads as merged: On
Damage Calculation: Damageprofiler
CleanUp: On
Create Report: On

```

These settings can be seen in table format in `06-additional_data_files`
under Data R05.

The EAGER runs were be submitted with:

```bash
EAGER=<PATH_TO>/1.92.55/bin/eager
EAGERCLI=<PATH_TO>/1.92.55/bin/eagercli

for FILE in $(find 03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/output/* -name '*.xml'); do
  unset DISPLAY && $EAGERCLI $(readlink -f $FILE)
done

```

For the screening data to clean up the EAGER results directories so
that they are in the same format as the script version others we ran the
following couple of commands.

> All production dataset files were run with EAGER, so clean up was not required
> and the default ReportTable output was used for [statistics reporting](r622-statistics)

To run clean-on on single libraries:

```bash
cd 03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/output

## Clean up
SAMPLE=LIB007.A0124
SAMTOOLS=<PATH_TO>/samtools_1.3/bin/samtools

```

And for multiple samples:

```bash

### R6.2 Post-Processing

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R6.2.1 EAGER preprocessing dataset BAM to FASTQ Conversion

As EAGER itself does not have ability to convert unmapped read BAMs to FASTQ,
 we manually ran this for EAGER-preprocessed files with:

```bash
FILES=($(find -L 03-preprocessing/{screening,deep}/human_filtering/output/{FUM,GOY,PES,GDN}*.2/ -name '*.extractunmapped.bam' -type f))

for i in 1:${#FILES[@]}; do
  samtools fastq ${FILES[$i]} | gzip > ${FILES[$i]} .fq.gz;
done
```

> :warning: The unmapped-read FASTQ files are not provided here due to their large size.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R6.2.2 Statistics

We then extracted the statistics of this pre-processing with the script
`02-scripts.backup/005-statistics_human_filtering.sh`. Once checked, we moved
the resulting `human_filtering_statistics.csv` output file to our `00-documents`
folder and renamed as `03-human_filtering_statistics.csv`.

```bash
SCRIPTS=02-scripts.backup

cd 03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering

"$SCRIPTS"/005-statistics_human_filtering.sh output/

## Copy to documentation folder
mv human_filtering_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv ..
cp ../human_filtering_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv ../../../00-documentation.backup/03-human_filtering_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv
```

> Note: if you get a "Runtime error (func=(main), adr=6): Divide by zero" error,
don't worry, this is related to the cluster factor calculation for when there
are no human reads after de-duplication. I just manually filled these in with NA.

The summarised results from this preprocessing can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R06

For the deep sequenced data, the EAGER table was used for report statistics (see
below forfurther information), and can be seen in `06-additional_data_files`
under Data R08.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R6.2.3 Library Merging

Next, we merged together libraries that were sequenced multiple times,
or individuals with multiple calculus samples.

A list of libraries that have been merged together can be seen for the screening
data at `06-additional_data_files` under Data R07 or
`00-documentation/04-library_merging_information.csv`. For the production
dataset the same is either under Data R09 or
at `00-documentation/17-samples_deep_library_merging_information_20190708.csv`.

The structure of the MPI-SHH sample naming system can be seen here:

![MPI-SHH LIMS naming structure](05-images/Figure_R00_XXX_MPISHHLIMSNameStructure/MPI-SHH_LIMS_NamingStructure.png)

Library merging in this case can therefore be worked out by merging together
any library that shares the first six character section of each library. For
example:

```text
CDC005.A0101
CDC005.A0101.170817

or

ECO002.B0101
ECO002.C0101
```

The two examples represent distinct individuals (but different libraries of a
single sample in the case of different `.A` characters or multiple sequencing
of the same library in the case of the date string `.170817`). In this study
we did not consider possible differences in sampling tooth source of the
calculus, and therefore pooled accordingly either at sampling or
_in silico_ here.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

##### Libraries not requiring merging

First, into our final output preprocessing directory (`03-preprocessing/*/library_merging/output`),
we quickly imported all files for all individuals as symlinks

```bash
cd 03-preprocessing/screening/library_merging

## Make directory
for DIR in ../../screening/human_filtering/output/*/; do
  mkdir "$(echo $DIR | rev | cut -d/ -f2 | rev)/"
done

## Make symlink of FastQ into new directory above.
for DIR in ../../screening/human_filtering/output/*/; do
  ln -s $(readlink -f "$DIR")/*fq.gz "$(echo $DIR | rev | cut -d/ -f2 | rev)/";
done
```

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

##### Libraries requiring merging

Then we removed the imported directories  of 'extra' samples/libraries that
needed to be merged.

```bash
rm \
ABM007.A0101/*.fq.gz \
ABM008.A0101/*.fq.gz \
BIT001.A0101/*.fq.gz \
CDC005.A0101/*.fq.gz \

TAF017.A0101/*.fq.gz \
TAF018.A0101/*.fq.gz \
WAL001.A0101/*.fq.gz
```

These extras were then merged into a single FASTQ file for each individual using
`cat`, and placed in an independent file in the output directories with the
following commands

```bash
INDIR=03-preprocessing/screening/human_filtering/output
OUTDIR=03-preprocessing/screening/library_merging

For screening data, the final number of reads going downstream analysis is also
recorded in the file `04-samples_library_merging_information.csv`. For libraries
sequenced twice (i.e. has `.SG.2` or a `date`, I manually added the two values
together.

For deep sequencing data, The same concatenating of multiple samples and/or
lanes was done for the deep sequencing samples. However the statistics were
summarised across multiple libraries using the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/099-eager_table_individual_summarised.Rmd`.

Visualisation of summary statistics can also be seen [below](#r64-preprocessing-results-summary).

### R6.3 Poly-G Trimming Assessment

The human DNA GC content could be a bit off in some of the new libraries
generated in this study, as we mostly sequenced with Illumina NextSeqs. These
have a 2 colour chemistry that considers no light emission as a 'G'. Thus,
empty or finished clusters can be read as long poly G reads - which can still
map to the human genome in regions with long repetitive regions. Modern
contamination with long human DNA reads on a failed flow cell cluster may also
containing poly-G stretches if the florescence failed before the entire read is
complete and the adapter had not been sequenced.

The polyG issue would not likely affect our ancient microbial data because
these should be so short that each read would have both ends of the read
entirely sequenced (the whole read with both adapters or most of both adapters
would fit in 75 cycles). Thus, adapter removal would remove anything that
comes after the adapters which would be the poly Gs. Poly G tails would
only affect single index reads, where the read itself is too short and doesn't
have an adapter to indicate the read has ended.

To get improved human DNA content calculations, we performed the following steps,
the output of which was stored in `04-analysis/screening/eager` under the
`polyGremoval*` directories.

1. AdapterRemoval with no quality trimming or merging, just adapter removal

    ```bash
    sbatch 02-scripts.backup/099-polyGcomplexity_filter_preFastPprep.sh
    ```

2. Clean up the output in `04-analysis/screening/eager/polyGremoval_input/output/` with

    ```bash
    find . ! -name '*fastq.gz' -type f -delete
    ```

3. Run FastP on output of AdapterRemoval with

    ```bash
    sbatch 02-scripts.backup/099-polyGcomplexity_filter.sh
    ```

4. Finally run the output of FastP again with EAGER. Note that we still need to
   run AR to merge reads, but it's not important for re-clipping as there shouldn't
   be any adapters, so will put minimum adapter overlap to 11 (EAGER doesn't
   allow merging only)

    ```text
    Organism: Human
    Age: Ancient
    Treated Data: non-UDG
    Pairment: Single End (R1) or Paired End (R1/R2)
    Input is already concatenated (skip merging): N
    Concatenate Lanewise together: N (as lane concatenation already done)
    Reference: HG19
    Name of mitochondrial chromosome: chrMT
  
    AdapterRemoval: N
      minimum adapter overlap: 11
    Mapping: BWA

    Remove Duplicates: DeDup
      Treat all reads as merged: Y
    Damage Calculation: Y
    CleanUp: On
    Create Report: On
    ```
  
To run each EAGER run in parallel, we again used
`02-scripts.backup/02-scripts.backup/021-eager_microbiota_slurm_array.sh` after
updating the path in the `find` command in the script to point to the
corresponding EAGER XML directory.

The resulting human mapping data after poly-G removal can be seen in
`00-documentation.backup/99-PolyGRemoved_HumanMapping_EAGERReport_output.csv`

Visualisation of summary poly-G trimming statistics can also be seen [below](#r64-preprocessing-results-summary).

### R6.4 Preprocessing Results Summary

Sequencing quality control results for both screening and production datasets
were generated in the script seen in
`02-scripts.backup/099-SequencingQCMetrics_v2.Rmd`.

The following figures also describe a subset of these preprocessing summary
statistics.

### R7.1 MALT

For the first step of analysing the microbiome content of dental calculus,
controls and comparative samples is to perform taxonomic binning and
classification. This allows us to rapidly identify what species are present in
each library.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R7.1.1 MALT Running

For taxonomic binning of reads of the **screening** dataset, we used MALT with
a wrapper script for efficient submission. The settings set in
`02-scripts/007-malt-genbank-nt_2017_2step_85pc_supp_0.01` are as follows:

- a read requires a minimum of 85% sequence identity (`-id`),
- it will only retain a second hit if the alignment is within 1% of the
  bit-score of the top scoring hit (`-top`)
- it will only keep a leaf-node on the tree if it has more than 0.01 of the hits
  over all the hits in the sample (`-supp`).
- it will only retain 100 possible hits per node.

We then ran our taxonomic binning job with the following command, providing
the input directory and a wild-cards to pick up all _merged_ files to
individual level, and an output directory.

```bash
02-scripts.backup/007-malt-genbank-nt_2017_2step_85pc_supp_0.01 \
03-preprocessing/screening/library_merging/*/*.fq.gz \
04-analysis/screening/malt/nt
```

This script aligns to the NCBI Nucleotide database (nt). For the CustomRefSeq
database, see [below](#r124-aadder-analysis)

#### R7.1.2 MALT Summary Statistics

To extract the summary statistics for all the MALT runs, we ran the following
command on the MALT logs produced by the script described above.

```bash
grep -e "Loading MEGAN File:" \
-e "Total reads:" \
-e "With hits:" \
-e "Alignments:" \
-e "Assig. Taxonomy" \
-e "Min-supp. changes" \
-e "Numb. Tax. classes:" \
-e "Class. Taxonomy:" \
-e "Num. of queries:" \
-e "Aligned queries:" \
-e "Num. alignments:" \
-e "MinSupport set to:" \
04-analysis/screening/malt/nt/*log | cut -d":" -f 2-99 > 00-documentation.backup/99-maltAlignedReadsSummary_raw_nt_$(date "+%Y%m%d").txt
```

> Note: if you have failed runs or single samples, and repeat the command,
> check to remove those 'failed' entries after running the grep command

To clean up the output of the `grep` command, and perform additional
calculation steps, we ran the following R
script: `02-scripts.backup/099-MALT_Summary_statistics.R`, the output of which
is recorded in
`00-documentation.backup/05-MALT_taxonomic_binning_summary_statistics_nt.tsv`
for nt and for RefSeq in
`00-documentation.backup/05-MALT_taxonomic_binning_summary_statistics_refseq_bacharchhomo_gcs_20181122.tsv`

The MinSupport value column(s) was then manually added to the individuals
column of our the final main screening metadata file
`00-documentation/02-calculus_microbiome-deep_evolution-individualscontrolssources_metadata_20190523.tsv`.

Summary statistics on the number of reads assigned per individual to the
MALT and RefSeq databases can be seen [below](#r73-assigned-reads-summaries-and-database-comparison)

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R7.2 MEGAN

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R7.2.1 MEGAN Running

Once MALT had completed, we needed to generate an OTU table of all the
alignments.

For this we used the GUI tool MEGAN6 that MALT is based on our local machine. To
generate the OTU table, we opened the MALT RMA6 files in MEGAN with absolute
counts, and ignored all unassigned reads.

To un-collapse the tree we pressed the following in the tool-bar:
Tree > Rank > \<Taxonomic level\>, the then select species
nodes with: Select > Rank > \<Taxonomic level\>.

Then, File > Export > Text (CSV) format, selected taxonName_to-count, summarised
and tab as a separator.

For a 'microbial-only' OTU table (excluding prokaryotes and synthetic DNA
sequences), we un-collapsed the tree by firstly selecting
'collapse non-prokaryotes' under the 'Tree' menu, and then Select > Rank >
\<taxonomic level\> to select only Bacteria and Archaea. We also exported
the a tree based on the same data with the option: File > Export > Tree,
and saved in Newick format. This was also done for each prokaryote taxonomic
level.

These were be saved in `04-analysis/screening/megan.backup`, but additionally
the corresponding `.megan`, `.nwk`  and OTU tables at various taxonomic
levels (as exported by MEGAN) for both Nt and [RefSeq](#r125-malt-refSeq)
databases can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R11.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R7.2.2 Additional Raw OTU Tables

For faster accessibility to OTU tables at different stages of downstream
analysis, we made raw MALT OTU tables with and without badly-preserved
individuals (see [below](#r8-preservation-screening)) and at
different min. support values (see [below](#r1012-min-support-testing))
were generated by the Notebook
`02-scripts.backup/016-MALT_otutable_generation.Rmd`. These tables are stored
as `.tsv` files in the `04-analysis/screening/megan.backup`
directory as well `06-additional_data_files` under Data R11.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R7.2.3 Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic MALT content Comparison

We were also interested in whether there were any overall patterns between the
samples in terms of broad taxonomic content.

Visualisation and statistical testing of whether the ratio of prokaryotic to
eukyarotic reads differs between well-preserved and badly-preserved samples can
be seen in `02-scripts.backup/099-cumulativedecay_vs_sourcetracker.Rmd`.
Visualisation of this analysis can be seen
[below](#r73-assigned-reads-summaries-and-database-comparison)

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R7.3 Assigned Reads Summaries and Database Comparison

To get an overview of the 'mapability' of the (merged) samples used in this, we
generated summary statistics of numbers of reads taxonomically assigned, as well
as made comparison between the two MALT databases. This was performed with the
R notebook `02-scripts.backup/099-MALTAssignmentResults.Rmd`.

Summary figures are below. Please see the main publication for further
discussion.

## R8 Preservation Screening

A crucial part of any ancient DNA study is to control for preservation of the
DNA content of any analysed samples. Due to taphonomic processes, the original
endogenous DNA can be come very degraded and also entirely lost. This can lead
to samples containing only contaminant DNA and thus cause major skews and
complications in downstream analysis. Identifying well-preserved samples
containing a sufficient fraction of the original microbiome is critical, but
equally so is assessing that their DNA is not derived from modern contamination.

### R8.1 Cumulative Percent Decay Plots

The MALT OTU table(s) alone does not give us much information about the genetic
preservation of the original oral signature within each individual.

To get a rapid idea of the level of identifiable oral taxa in each individual, I
came up with a simple visualisation to show how abundant the (hpoefully
endogenous) oral signal in the samples are. It is based on the decay of the
fraction of oral taxa identified when looking from most to least abundant taxa
within a sample. The concept is further described in the main publication
supplement, but a schematic on how to interpret them can be seen here:

---

![Schematic of how Cumulative Percentage Decay Plots Work](05-images/Figure_R08_SCE_CumulativeDecay_Schematic/CumulativeDecay_Schematic.png)

**Figure R8 | Schematic diagram of a cumulative percent decay method of preservation assessment.** **a** example curves of a theoretical sample consisting of purely oral taxa (top left), and a theoretical sample containing no oral taxa (top right). For the archaeological samples, a well-preserved sample (bottom left) will consist mostly of oral taxa but may include uncharacterised or contaminant taxa leading to a non-linear relationship, but remaining above an oral taxon fraction percent of 50% (as identified in modern plaque samples). An archaeological sample (bottom right) with no endogenous oral content will have few oral taxa, and may have occasional modern contaminants resulting in a non-linear relationship. **b** a representation of the method for calculating the rank from which to begin assessing whether a sample decay curve goes above the 'well-preserved' fraction threshold, accounting for high variation in mixed preservation samples with both oral and non-oral/uncharacterised taxa at higher ranks. Given the large differences between the initial ranks due to small denominators, a 'burn-in' like procedure is applied. The rank at which the difference change between each subsequent rank does not exceed the standard deviation of all rank differences, is set as the rank from which, it is assessed whether the sample curve exceeds the preservation threshold (here 50% for the NCB nt OTU table). A curve that does not exceed this threshold at any point from this rank onwards, is considered not to have sufficient preservation for downstream analysis.

---

This visualisation requires two objects: an OTU table
from MEGAN at species level (generated [above](#r721-megan-running)) and a
database of taxa with their 'sources'.

To generate the database of oral taxa, I used the steps outlined in the
notebook
`02-scripts.backup/013-Organism_Isolation_Source_Database_Generation.Rmd`.

> Note that database also requires manual curation over time as more taxa are
identified and the isolation sources reported.

This database used in this study can be
seen under `06-additional_data_files` under Data R16, or stored under
`00-documentation` as `07-master_oralgenome_isolationsource_database.tsv`

To actually generate the visualisations, the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/014-cumulative_proportion_decay_curves.Rmd` describes how to
calculate the percent decay curves, including burn-in calculations, and how to
display the curves.

The resulting list(s) of individuals passing or failing to pass this threshold
can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R17 or
`04-analysis/screening/cumulative_decay.backup`, and summaries of how many
samples passed the calculated threshold in the tables below.

![Cumulative Percentage Decay Plots for calculus and comparative sources](05-images/Figure_R09_SCA_CumulativePercentageDecayPlots/SuppFigSX_CumulativePercentDecay_ntRefseqCombined_titlesfixed_EDIT.png)

**Figure R9 | Cumulative percent decay plots of fraction of oral taxa across taxa ordered by abundance rank.** Taxonomic assignment against the: **a** NCBI nt database, and **b** a custom NCBI RefSeq database showing a large number of calculus samples displayed greater levels of preservation (blue), and although a smaller number do not pass the estimated preservation threshold (red). Plots are limited to 250 rank positions (x-axis) for visualization purposes. Thresholds are selected based on observations that all sources and controls do not increase about 50% (nt) and 65% (RefSeq) of fraction of oral taxon. Point at which the per-sample threshold is considered is based on when the fluctuation of the fraction of oral taxa (i.e. fraction difference between a taxon and next abundant taxon) does not exceed the standard deviation of all differences of the rank.

### R8.2 Source Estimation

We next wanted to compare our screening method to a less-suitable but more
established approach, Sourcetracker analysis. However this typically uses an OTU
table of 16S rRNA reads to estimate the proportion of OTUs derived from the
sources that are also in your sample.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R8.2.1 16S Extraction

As we have shotgun data, we instead extracted reads with sequence similarity
to translated 16S rRNA sequences and ran on that.

The script `02-scripts.backup/009-preprocessing-16s_mapping` works very much
the same way as with the [human DNA preprocessing](#r611-script-version), but
mapping to the SILVA database and converting the unmapped-only reads (i.e.
non-human reads from the preprocessing) to FASTA
format, with a particular header format (`>sample.name_1`) that is
compatible with QIIME.

```bash
INDIR=02-scripts.backup/03-preprocessing/screening/library_merging
OUTDIR=02-scripts.backup/03-preprocessing/screening/silva_16s_reads
SCRIPTS=02-scripts.backup/02-scripts.backup

for LIBDIR in "$INDIR"/*/; do
  LIBNAME=$(echo "$LIBDIR" | rev | cut -d/ -f2 | rev)
  if [ -d "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME" ]; then
    printf "\n $LIBNAME already Processed \n\n"
  else
    mkdir "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME"
    $SCRIPTS/009-preprocessing_16s_mapping.sh $OUTDIR/$LIBNAME $LIBDIR $LIBNAME
    sleep 1
  fi
done
```

To get the number of 16S rRNA reads that mapped, we can ran script
`02-scripts.backup/06-16s_extraction_statistics.sh`, and copied the resulting
file into our documents directory with

```bash
SCRIPTS=02-scripts.backup/02-scripts.backup

cd 02-scripts.backup/03-preprocessing/screening


## Generate stats
"$SCRIPTS"/011-16s_extraction_statistics.sh silva_16s_reads/

## Copy into documentation folder
mv silva_16s_reads/16s_extraction_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv .
cp 16s_extraction_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv ../../00-documentation.backup/05-16s_extraction_statistics_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")".csv
```

> The mapping results files are not provided here due to their large size.

The summary statistics for the number of 16S reads identified can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R12 or
`00-documentation.backup/05-16s_extraction_statistics.csv`, as well as in the
figures below.

#### R8.2.2 16S Clustering

To assign taxonomic classifications to the identified 16S reads, we used then
used QIIME (v1.9) to cluster the reads by similarity, and assign a
taxonomic 'name'. We remained with using OTU clustering rather than the more
recent (and more powerful/statistically valid) ASV (amplicon sequence variant)
methods. This is because we are not dealing directly with amplicon data, and we
also have damage which would affect reliability of assignment. Finally, the
more recent version of QIIME, QIIME2, has been made much less flexible for
non-amplicon data (at the time of writing) and I couldn't work out how to adapt
the data. For our rough preservational screening purposes using QIIME 1.9 was
deemed sufficient.

Firstly, we made a combined FASTA file containing all the 16S reads
from all the samples.

```bash
INDIR=02-scripts.backup/03-preprocessing/screening/silva_16s_reads
OUTDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/input

rm "$OUTDIR"/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna.gz
touch "$OUTDIR"/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna.gz

for SAMPLE in "$INDIR"/*; do
  find "$SAMPLE"  -maxdepth 1 -name '*_renamed.fa.gz' -exec cat {} >> \
  "$OUTDIR"/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna.gz \;
done
```

> The FASTA file is not provided here due to their large size.

For OTU clustering itself, we additionally defined custom parameters that have
been adapted for shotgun data by LMAMR in Oklahoma. These are stored in the
file `02-scripts.backup/010-params_CrefOTUpick.txt`, as well as in the table
below.

---

**Table R3 | Non-default parameters used for QIIME closed-reference clustering.**

| Parameter                         | Value |
|-----------------------------------|------:|
| pick_otus:max_accepts             | 100   |
| pick_otus:max_rejects             | 500   |
| pick_otus:word_length             | 12    |
| pick_otus:stepwords               | 20    |
| pick_otus:enable_rev_strand_match | TRUE  |

---

To actually run the clustering analysis and generate our OTU table we ran the
following.

```bash
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/input
OUTDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/output
GREENGENESDB=<PATH_TO>/qiime_default_reference/gg_13_8_otus/
SCRIPTS=02-scripts.backup/02-scripts.backup

gunzip "$INDIR/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna.gz"

pick_closed_reference_otus.py \
-i $INDIR/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna \
-o $OUTDIR/otu_picking \
-a \
-O 16 \
-r $GREENGENESDB/rep_set/97_otus.fasta \
-t $GREENGENESDB/taxonomy/97_otu_taxonomy.txt \
-p $SCRIPTS/010-qiime_1_9_1_params_CrefOTUpick.txt


```

Once finished we re-gzipped the input fasta file to save disk space with:

```bash
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/input

pigz -p 4 "$INDIR/silva_16s_reads_concatenated.fna"
```

To get some basic statistics about the OTU picking, we used the BIOM package
that came with the QIIME environment.

```bash
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/input
OUTDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/output

cd "$OUTDIR"

biom summarize-table -i "$OUTDIR"/otu_picking/otu_table.biom >> \
"$OUTDIR"/otu_picking/otu_table_summary.txt

## Check with:
head "$OUTDIR"/otu_picking/otu_table_summary.txt -n 20
```

This summary can also be  seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R13.

Sourcetracker (I realised later) doesn't do rarefaction properly as it
allows sampling with replacement of the OTUS. Therefore, we needed to manually
remove samples that have less than 1000 OTUs (which is the default rarefaction
level in Sourcetracker - [see below](#r823-sourcetracker)). Looking at the table
summary in Data R13 summary shows that fortunately this will remove very few
samples and will remove mostly blanks.

```bash
cd 04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking

filter_samples_from_otu_table.py \
-i "$INDIR"/otu_table.biom \
-o "$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered.biom \
-n 1000


biom summarize-table -i "$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered.biom >> \
"$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered_summary.txt

## Check with:
head "$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered_summary.txt -n 20
```

We also only wanted to look at genus level assignments, given species specific
IDs could be unreliable due to damage and different mixtures of strain in
different individuals.

To filter to Genus (L6) level we then did

```bash
cd 04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking

## For Genus
summarize_taxa.py \
-i "$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered.biom \
-o "$INDIR" \
-a \
-L 6

## Fix crappy taxon ID that breaks loading into R when running Sourcetracker :+1: due to hanging quote
sed s#\'Solanum#Solanum#g otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered_L6.txt > otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered_L6_cleaned.tsv
```

With this final OTU table - as seen (in both biom or TSV format) in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R14 or
`04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking` -  we could now run
Sourcetracker.

#### R8.2.3 Sourcetracker

With the OTU tables, we are now able to compare the environmental sources
(plaque, gut, skin, sediment etc.) to each of the calculus samples and estimate
the proportion of each sample that resembles the sources. This thus can
help indicate the level of (hopefully) endogenous oral-content preservation in
the samples.

Sourcetracker requires an OTU table (generated above) and a metadata file
that tells the program what libraries in the OTU are a 'sink' or a 'source'.
This metadata file used in this case is recorded here,
`02-scripts.backup/02-microbiome_calculus-deep_evolution-individualscontrolssources_metadata.tsv`,
which I then tried to use for all downstream analysis. In particular here we
needed to ensure there was an 'Env' and a 'SourceSink' column.

To then to run Sourcetracker we ran the following command:

```bash
## change to new directory for output directories
INDIR=04-analysis/screening/qiime/output/otu_picking
OUTDIR=04-analysis/screening/sourcetracker.backup/

MAPPINGFILE=00-documentation.backup/02-calculus_microbiome-deep_evolution-individualscontrolssources_metadata_20190429.tsv

Rscript \
sourcetracker_for_qiime.r \
-i "$INDIR"/otu_table_1000OTUsfiltered_L6_cleaned.tsv \
-m "$MAPPINGFILE" \
-o "$OUTDIR"/otu_table_L6_1000_"$(date +"%Y%m%d")" \
-r 1000 \
-v

```

For plotting of these - with comparison to the cumulative percent decay plots,
 I use the following R notebook to summarise the results:
 `02-scripts.backup/099-cumulativedecay_vs_sourcetracker.Rmd`. Discussion
 of the comparison can be seen in the main publication, however there was
 a generally good concordance between the two approaches.

 The final proportions (with standard deviation) can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R18.

![Comparison between Sourcetracker and CumulativePercentDecay Plots](05-images/Figure_R14_SCB_Sourcetracker_vs_CumulativePercentdecay/SupFigX_SourcetrackerVsCPD_st2bar_cpdtext_20190923.png)

**Figure R14 | Stacked bar plots representing the estimated proportion of sample resembling a given source, as estimated by Sourcetracker across all calculus samples.** Visual inspection shows general concordance between the cumulative percent decay method and Sourcetracker estimation is seen.

### R8.3 Ratio of Eukaryotic to Prokaryotic Alignments

Returning back to the MALT tables and cumulative percent decay plots, we had
also observed that the older samples and those with weaker indication of oral
content appeared to have a greater ratio of prokaryotic to eukartotic
alignments.

We also explored whether this ratio could be used as an additional validation of
oral microbiome preservation in ancient samples. Visualisation and statistical
testing of these ratios can be seen in the figure below, and was generated as
described in the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/099-cumulativedecay_vs_sourcetracker.Rmd`. For discussion
of the results, please refer to the main publication.

**Figure R15 | Comparison of ratios of bacterial/archaeal/viral over eukaryotic alignments, between ancient calculus samples that passed the cumulative decay cut off for preservation.** Samples not passing the preservation threshold as estimated with the cumulative percent decay plots, tend to have smaller ratio and therefore greater amounts of eukaryotic DNA reads being assigned.

### R8.4 Damage Patterns

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R8.4.1 MEx-IPA

To rapidly screen for damage patterns indicative of ancient DNA on the
observed core microbiome ([see below](#r10-core-microbiome-analysis)), we
[ran MaltExtract](#r102-core-microbiome-maltextract) on all output of MALT,
with the core microbiome as input list.

We then developed [MEx-IPA](https://github.com/jfy133/MEx-IPA) to rapidly
visualise ancient DNA characteristics across all samples and core taxa.

The results files for this analysis can be seen in
`04-analysis/screening/maltExtract/output/AnthropoidsHominidaeHoiminini_core_20190509`.

> :warning: the text files in this directory are gzipped and must be
decompressed before loading into MEx-IPA!

If you do not wish to clone this whole repository (which is very large),
you can use the following suggestions from
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18194523/11502856). However, in
case that link doesn't work - the most stable method is to use subversion
(`svn`).

```bash
svn checkout https://github.com/jfy133/Hominid_Calculus_Microbiome_Evolution/trunk/04-analysis/screening/maltExtract/output/AnthropoidsHominidaeHoiminini_core_20190509
find -name '*gz' -type f -exec gunzip {} \;
```

Then copy and paste `<path>/<to>/AnthropoidsHominidaeHoiminini_core_20190509`
into MEx-IPA to find this.

Example reports for the two oldest Neanderthals (PES001 and GDN001), can be
seen below in Figure R16, where for multiple known oral species, both cases
display indicative characteristics of true endogenous DNA.

---

![Example MEx-IPA Reports](05-images/Figure_R16_SDA_Example_MEx-IPA_Reports/FigureSXX_ExampleMEX-IPAPartialReports_nt_AnthropoidCore_PES_GDN_FretiFusoTannTrepo.png)

**Figure R16 | Example of MEx-IPA reports from the MaltExtract tool of the HOPS pipeline for two Neanderthal individuals, across four known oral microbiome taxa.** Individual-Taxon combination shows: C to T misincorporation lesions indicative of DNA deamination; read length distribution with a typical peak <50 bp indicative of fragmented DNA; edit distance and percent identity to the given reference which both show close similarity to the oral reference genome in most cases (1-2 edit distance peak; and 95% identity peak identity). Note that _Fretibacterium fastidiosum_ shows a higher edit distance and low percent identity score, suggesting the reads are likely derived from a relative of that taxon that does not have a genome represented in the database used (NCBI nt 2017).

#### R8.4.2 DamageProfiler

To generate additional confirmation of damage patterns in oral taxa, the
screening data was also mapped to a subset of observed core microbiome
reference genomes (see
[below](#r111-production-dataset-sequencing-depth-calculations)), using EAGER.

DamageProfiler results were collated and visualised with the R script
`02-scripts.backup/099-Coretaxa_SubSet_DamageProfiler_Summary.R`. An example of the range of damage signals in ancient Human remains can be seen below in Figure R17. Again showing the presence of multiple well-preserved endogenous DNA of
oral taxa.

### R8.5 Laboratory Contaminants

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R8.5.1 decontam

In addition to identifying well preserved samples, we can also remove possibly
contaminating OTUs from our sample's OTU tables that are derived from the
laboratory environment, we can use the R package `decontam`. The idea here
is to use this to reduce the number of noisy taxa in the downstream
compositional analysis, e.g. false positive clustering due to laboratory batch
 effects.

The method in the `decontam` package uses library quantification information
to trace inverse correlations in OTU abundance compared to DNA abundance - where
laboratory derived taxa appear more abundant in controls versus true samples.

 We manually added the library quantification values (qPCR) to our
main metadata file
`02-scripts.backup/02-microbiome_calculus-deep_evolution-individualscontrolssources_metadata.tsv`.

We then ran `decontam` following the `decontam` tutorial vignette on CRAN as
described here `02-scripts.backup/015-decontam_contamination_detection_analysis.Rmd`.

The final list of contaminants for all methods and databases can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R19 and `04-analysis/screening/decontam.backup`,
with a summary below in Table R4.

This list of OTUs was subsequently removed from OTU tables in all downstream
analyses when indicated.

---

**Table R4 | Summary of OTUs detected across each shotgun taxonomic binner/classifier and databases as potential contaminants by the R package decontam.** MetaPhlAn2 was run for functional analysis [below](#r1231-metaphlan2). While MetaPhlAn2 was run as reference but wasn't utilised, the contaminants were not removed downstream due to unknown effects of removing these for [HUMANn2](#r1232-humann2).

### R8.5.2 Contaminant Impact Check

We observed a high number of putative contaminant OTUs when using our strict
decontam parameters. We wanted to see how much this would provisionally impact
our downstream analyses by investigating how many actual reads the OTUs consist
of a sample. The R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/099-decontam_OTU_impact_check.Rmd` describes how we did this.

We see that despite large numbers of contaminants are detected by decontam as a
fraction of overall OTUs, this only makes up a minority fraction of actual
alignments in the MALT OTU table in well preserved samples - suggesting that
the majority of contaminants are derived from low-abundant taxa. This
is shown in figure R18.

---

![Percentage alignments of sample vs. preservation estimation](05-images/Figure_R18_SXX_FractionContaminantOTUMALTAlignments/ContaminantOTUAlignment_to_preservation_comparison.png)

**Figure R18 | Fraction of MALT Alignments derived from putative contaminant OTUs show only small effect on well-preserved samples** Individuals are ordered by percentage of alignments that are derived from OTUs considered putative contaminants by decontam and removed from downstream analysis. Colour indicates whether the individual was considered to be well-preserved or not based on the cumulative percentage decay curves with the within standard variation burn-in method.

## R9 Compositional Analysis

After filtering to contain only well-preserved samples and removing possible
contaminants, we then could begin comparison of the calculus microbiomes of
our different host groups. We wanted to identify taxonomic similarities and
differences between each of the groups to help reconstruct the evolutionary
(co-)history of the microbiomes and their hosts.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R9.1 Principal Coordinate Analysis

To explore if we have a structure in our data that can describe differences
between each group we want to explore, we performed a Principal Coordinate
Analysis to reduce the variation between the samples to human-readable
dimensions. An important aspect of this analysis was the use of Compositional
Data (CoDA) principles - here implemented with PhILR - which allow us to apply
'traditional' statistics to taxonomic group comparisons.

The steps for the generation of PCoA are described in the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/017-PhILR_PCoA_20190527.Rmd`. However, the notebook ending
up having lots of options during parameter exploration  (see below). Therefore
I also used `knitr::purl()`to create a script version of the R notebook that
accepts arguments via the command line.

To generate the script, we ran:

```r
knitr::purl("02-scripts.backup/017-PhILR_PCoA_20190527.Rmd", "02-scripts.backup/017-PhILR_PCoA_20190527_script.R", documentation = 2)
```

Then we generated the PCoAs based on different sets of combinations of
variables of:

- Whether to use the NCBI nt database or custom NCBI RefSeq OTU tables
- Whether to analyse at genus or species taxonomic level of taxa in the OTU table
- Whether comparative sources are included or not
- Whether controls are included or not
- Whether to include low preservation samples or not
- Which low preservation samples filtering list to use (see the Cumulative Percentage Decay notebook for further above for futher explanation)
- Either minimum support multipler of 7 for genus or 4 for species (the value in the commands are multipliers of 0.01: the default MALT min. support value set above; the parameters were selected based on the core microbiome calculations [below](#r1012-min-support-testing))

The commands for these permutates are therefore as follows:

```bash
i=7

The R script for summarising the results across all runs is named
`017-PhILR_PCoA_summaries.R`, and the output files for each combination are in
  `00-documentation` under `philr_permanova_*_summary.tsv`.

Individual plots of each of the PCoAs and additional considerations can be
seen in `04-analysis/screening/philr.backup` More specific comparisons of different parameters can be seen in Figures R19-21. For discussion of the
results, refer to the main publication.

Of particular note, given the sparse nature of our data, we compared between
two zero-replacement methods. This was performed with the script
`02-scripts.backup/017-PhILR_PCoA_ZeroReplacementComparison_20190527.Rmd`, and
we observed little difference (Figure R19).

### R9.2 PERMANOVA

To provide statistical support for the observations made from the PCoAs above
of host groups having putatively distinct calculus microbiomes, we performed
PERMANOVA analysis. This was run in the same R notebook as the PCoAs above
(`02-scripts.backup/017-PhILR_PCoA_20190527.Rmd`).

The PERMANOVA output related analysis can be seen in Tables R5-7, of which
further interpretation can be found in the main text.

The R script for summarising the results across all runs is also
`017-PhILR_PCoA_summaries.R`, and the output files for each combination are in
  `00-documentation` under `philr_permanova_*_summary.tsv`.

Overall we found that despite some overlap (as seen in the PCoA analysis, the
calculus microbiomes of each host genus could be considered statistically
distinct.

### R9.3 Hierarchical Clustering Heatmaps

To visualise possible drivers of similarity and differences between the
different host genera, we applied hierarchical clustering on the contaminant and
preservation filtered MALT OTU tables, which are then displayed as heatmaps.

This is performed in the R notebook and script version
`02-scripts.backup/045-Compositional_Heatmaps.R(md)`

The procedure again follows CoDa principles by performing CLR
transformation of the OTU matrix (rather than PhILR as so to retain information
on the actual taxa classes that are driving differences), upon which
unsupervised clustering of host taxa and microbial taxa is applied. The
clustering algorithm actually used is selected automatically within the script.
Finally, a heatmap representation of the clustering is generated.

The script version allows additional filtering as above for the Principle
Coordinate and PERMANOVA analyses (database, taxonomic levels, with/without
sources, with/without controls, with/without bad samples (+ bad sample removal
method option)) and also additional taxon filtering, zero-replacement method,
additional min. support filtering. Finally, an additional filter was included: a
prevalence filter (i.e. a taxon is only kept if it is in _n_ number of
individuals across the dataset).

We modified the above parameters to find the combination that resulted in the
most robust overall bootstrap support in the deepest nodes (i.e. the ones we
are most interested in this study - splits between host genus level clades)

```bash
## Additional min. support filtering, no genus filtering
Rscript 02-scripts.backup/045-Compositional_Heatmaps_20190806_script.Rmd nt species noSources noControls out withinvariation none pseudo 4 5
```

The sample clustering with no taxon filtering, additional min. support of 0.04,
and prevalence filtering set to 5 was selected. This was based on it having
generally the highest bootstrap values in the internal nodes, and the phylogeny
showing 'cleanest' clustering of individuals of the same host genus falling
together. Interpretation of these heatmaps is described in the main publication.

To aid interpretation, phenotypic data of the taxa displayed in the heatmap was
performed via `02-scripts.backup/046-bacdive_searcher.R`, and added manually to
the heatmap plots using Inkscape, which was recorded in the file
`00-documentation.backup/99-Heatmap_ManualBlockDescriptions_alltaxa_minsupportmultiplier4_minprevalence4_databasent_metadata.tsv`

The final figures for both databases can be seen collated in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R20 or individual files in
 `04-analysis/screening/compositional_heatmaps.backup`.

 In general we observed _Gorilla_ and _Alouatta_ displayed more diversity of
 aerobic taxa,  whereas _Pan_ had lower diversity but consisted primarily of
 anaerobic and late colonising taxa.

#### R9.3.1 Zero replacement validation

We also checked whether the hierarchical clustering results was affected by the
zero replacement model, with the same script and otherwise the same settings.

```bash
Rscript 02-scripts.backup/045-Compositional_Heatmaps_20190806_script.Rmd nt species noSources noControls out withinvariation none czm 4 5

```

Comparing the zero replacement methods showed no difference between clustering.
There were only cosmetic tree topology changes with clade rotation, i.e. no
structural changes. The output is saved as in the same directory at above.

#### R9.3.2 Indicator Analysis

To confirm that the species corresponding to the grouping observed in the
hierarchical clustering, we ran Indicator Analysis to find species that are
'indicative' of certain host genera combinations. This was performed with the R
notebook `02-scripts.backup/020-Indicator_analysis_20190808.Rmd`.

The results can be seen can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data
R21 or in `04-analysis/screening/indicspecies.backup`, with discussion in
the main publication.

### R9.4 Clustering by Diet

To revisit the question and results posed by Weyrich _et al._ (2017) _Nature_,
regarding clustering of the calculus microbiomes individuals by subsistence
strategy, we similarly performed PCoA, PERMANOVA, hierarchical clustering on
Neanderthals and ancient humans - however in this case with a more balanced
sampling strategy. This was performed in the notebook
`02-scripts.backup/017-PERMANOVA_HomoOnly_Dietary_20190916.Rmd` and
corresponding script version.

The results are saved in `04-analysis.backup/screening/philr_dietary.backup/`
and seen in Figures R22 and R23.

More discussion of the results can be seen in the main
publication, however overall we observe that we are unable to distinguish
between each 'subsistence' strategy given other factors such as age or region.
Much more balanced and controlled sampling is required to address this question
to recover whether diet indeed effects the taxonomic compositional of oral
microbiomes.

### R10.1 Core Microbiome Calculation

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R10.1.1 Core Microbiome Procedure

Given the overlap between each host genus as identified
[above](#r91-compositional-analysis) in the principle coordinate analysis, we
also wished to find microbiota taxa that are potentially present across various
combinations of the host genera.

For this we ran a core microbiome estimation analysis via intersection of
presence/absence of different OTUs, as shown in the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_20190902.Rmd`. A script version of the
notebook is also provided under
`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_20190902_script.R`.

See the notebook and main publication for more details in how the intersection
procedure was constructed (to control for biological and preservational
variation), however Figure R24 shows a schematic for this.

**Figure R24 | Schematic of parameters used for selecting taxa considered to be core to a host genus population and host genus population themselves.** Requiring half of individuals of a population (to be core to a population) allows for inter-individual biological variability and preservation variability. Requiring two-thirds of the populations of a host genus (to be core to a host genus), ensures a particular taxon is core in multiple populations or subspecies and is not unique to a single population (which may also reflect preservational or curational backgrounds). _Alouatta_ is exempt from the population level parameter due to the inclusion of only a single population.

---

We found that requiring a taxon to be present in 50% of a population
individuals, and 66% of host populations provided robustness against
preservational and biological variability, while having enough
individuals/populations for corroboration that a taxon could be considered
'core'.

#### R10.1.2 Min. Support Testing

Visual inspection of the initial results of the intersection analysis with the
number of individual parameters selected above, showed incorporation of
well-known environmental contaminatant taxa still occurred.

We therefore took a conservative approach and explored further optimal minimum
support values (extrapolated from [above](#r712-malt-summary-statistics)) that
removed well-known environmental taxa but did not equally remove well-known
oral-specific taxa.

To do this we re-ran with a variant of the notebook in the section
[above](#r1011-core-microbiome-procedure), but with different minimum support
multipliers.

Code for this procedure can be seen in
`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_ParameterTesting_20190902.Rmd`), we
collated the results from each database and taxonomic level into a single set
of results using the R script
`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_summaries_20190902.R`. This collected set
of results can be seen in

`00-documentation.backup/23-intersection_proktaxapassingthresholdsstats_20190211.tsv`

and

`00-documentation.backup/24-intersection_proktaxapassingthresholdstaxalist_20190211.tsv`

Figure R25 shows the results of increasing the minimum support filter at
genus and species level for both databases.

**Figure R25 | Alluvial diagram showing effects of increasing the minimum abundance threshold to the MALT OTU table-based core microbiome calculations. Increasing from 0.04% to 0.07% shows minimal changes in combination assignment.** Comparisons are between the nt (top) and RefSeq (bottom) databases, and at genus (left) and species (right) taxonomic levels. Stacked bars represent the number of taxa to each combination, and alluviums represent the assignment of a given taxon between each minimum support threshold. Plots created using the ggalluvial R package 273, with input data as MALT aligned and MEGAN exported OTU tables excluding putative laboratory contaminants, badly preserved samples, and taxa with minimum support values < 0.07% (genus level) and < 0.04% (species level).

---

Setting a 0.07% minimum support value at genus level and 0.04% for species was
sufficient to remove all well-known environmental or contaminant taxa while
retaining well-known oral taxa. Furthermore, these parameters generally removed
remaining laboratory contaminants being considered core to a 'controls + host
genus' combination.

The raw data for the min. support permutation comparison can be seen under
`06-additional_data_files` in Data R23.

#### R10.1.3 Single Population Testing

During sample-preservation filtering
[above](#r81-cumulative-percent-decay-plots), one of the Gorilla populations
was left with a single individual - which could cause a 'false positive'
support for a core taxa, if the taxa wasn't actually present in most individuals
of that population.

We therefore looked a the effect of removing the single individual
population for Gorillas, with the script version of the core microbiome notebook,
(`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_ParameterTesting_20190902.R`)
and permutating whether any populations with a single individual were dropped
or not.

```bash
## Final being minSupport of X, 0.5 inds of population, and 66 pops of genus,
## min. support 0.7 for genus and 0.4 for species, and testing whether dropping
## single individual populations makes a difference.

**Figure R26 | Alluvial diagram showing effects of dropping and retaining a single-individual Gorilla population in core microbiome calculations at genus and species taxonomic levels.** Dropping the single-individual population results in minor combination assignments, mostly taxa being assigned to being core to the compositionally similar Alouatta combinations. Stacked bars represent the number of taxa to each combination, and alluviums represent the assignment of a given taxon between dataset. Plots created using the ggalluvial R package, with input as MALT NCBI nt aligned and MEGAN exported OTU tables with putative laboratory contaminants, badly preserved samples, and taxa with minimum support values < 0.07% (genus level) and < 0.04% (species level) removed.

The raw data for the comparison of excluding single individual populations can
be seen under`06-additional_data_files` in Data R24.

Individual visualisations and results for each parameter run can be seen in
`04-analysis/screening/presenceabsence_intersection.backup/`.

Discussion of these results can be seen in the main publication. In general,
only minor differences were observed suggesting the Gorilla core was generally
robust.

#### R10.1.4 Bootstrapping of Core Microbiome Calculations

To assess the robusticity of our overall core microbiome calculations, we
additionally performed subsampling and bootstrapping analysis of each host
genera. By subsampling and randomly selecting the individuals of each host
genera, we aimed to see how often a given microbial taxon was considered
'core' to a given host-genus combination.

The code can be seen under
`02-scripts/018-CoreMicrobiome_20200908_complex_bootstrapping.Rmd`.

We ran the notebook for each database and microbial taxa level (at the
corresponding min. support filters), both with and without controls. We observed
that for the main 'anthropoid' core taxa (the term here used for Hominids and _Alouatta), in most cases lower bootstrap values
occured due to re-assignment with the 'anthropoid+control' combination. We reasoned
we could perform the bootstrapping without blanks given the low-biomass nature
of them making picking up oral taxa (a common contaminant) is likely as the number
of taxa are already low. i.e. tail filters (such as min. support) would not remove
these oral axa even if the number of reads of reads a very low to negliable, as
the min. support tail applies on a per-sample basis - in other words, the
behaviour of the min. support filter has less an effect in removing contaminants
on controls compared to samples. As we wished to check robusticity of the core
taxa of actual samples, it was OK to exclude these in this particular
bootstrapping test. We therefore re-ran the core microbiome calculations with
1000 subsampling replicates (with replacement), both including and excluding controls.

The outcome of these bootstrapping results can be seen in
`04-analysis/screening/presenceabsence_intersection/99-coremicrobiome_presenceabsence_pergroup_bootstrapped_complete_*`,
with combinations of which database was used (nt or refseq), which microbial
taxonomic level used (species or genus, with corresponding minsupport values).
Two files are created for each one with all possible combinations encountred for
each taxon (`_complete_`), and another with just the most commonly found
combination (`_tophits_`).

A comparison between the nt bootstrapping runs with and without controls being
included can be seen in
`04-analysis/screening/presenceabsence_intersection/99-coremicrobiome_presenceabsence_pergroup_bootstrapped_complete_nt_speciesgenus_withwithoutcontrols_comparison.tsv`.
A condensed version of this comparison can be seen in Table R8.

**Table R8 | Comparison of core micrbiome bootstrappig results when including and excluding controls** Bootstrapping was performed on all host groups (and controls), with 1000 replicates. FALSE/TRUE column headers refer to exclusion or inclusion of controls respectively. Bold indicate values equal to or exceeding 75%. Note genus level taxa have min. support values of 0.07 whereas species level taxa have a min. support value of 0.04.

When considering a bootstrap cut off of 75% and excluding controls, the majority
of the Hominid and _Alouatta_ core taxa can be considered to be found robust when randomly
subsampling (with replacement), with only Capnocytophaga falling below this at
71.6. For this particular taxon, alternative combinations that appeared during
bootstrapping replicates were the following: Alouatta:Gorilla:Homo,
Alouatta:Homo, Alouatta:Pan:Homo. That there are multiple different combinations
occuring, rather than a consistent single alternative, this may suggest this
taxon may still be prevalent in all host genera just has fewer read abundances
and therefore detection maybe more stochastic depending on each individual's
biofilm make up. A similar inteperretaion can also be applied to the other lower
values such as Tannerella, Olsenella, Porphyromonas and Treponema, who  mostly
display 3 or more alternative combinations rather than a single alternative; all
of which are different combinations of all the host genera (i.e. not
consistently with one or two host genera), suggesting common presence across all
host genera but at a lower prevalence - possibly again due to low read levels.
Given the three 'red complex' taxa, are mostly known to be more commonly found
in more mature calculus deposits, the lower bootstrap value may represent an
artfacet of the maturity of the sampled calculus from these individuals (i.e.
only when multiple individuals with mature deposits are including in subsampling
does the core microbiome of that taxa is the taxon assigned to wider
combinations)

Inclusion of controls sees a reduction in the bootstraps in most cases, at
varying levels. This is somewhat to be expected due to oral taxa being common
contaminants in lab reagents, and min. support values (i.e. tail trimming)
having a less of a effect (i.e. the fewer overall reads sequenced due to the
low biomass nature of controls meaning fewer true low-level contaminants taxa are
removed because the overall number of reads is low). Across all the
well supported bootstrap values. Most hominid/_Alouatta_ core microbiome assignments
are reduced due to being assigned to a control combination.  In particular,
_Streptococus_ and _Actinomyces_ sees the largest drops, however these are
highly diverse genera and therefore non-oral species under these genera are
likely to be present in skin and other modern human contaminants sources. This
therefore does not indicate these are not authentic oral taxa given other
lines of evidence at species level as shown in other analysis.

#### R10.1.5 Investigation into Mycobacterium as Core Genus

In the resulting list of taxa that were a part of the core of each combination
of host taxa, we observed that _Mycobacterium_  was able to pass our minimum
support despite being a common soil contaminant.  We investigated this further
in an extension of the original Core Microbiome calculation script which is
under `02-scripts.backup` as
`099-CoreMicrobiome_ParameterTesting_and_MycobacteriumInvestigation_20190902.Rmd`

---

![Distribution of Mycobacterium reads in MALT Nt database](05-images/Figure_R27_SFD_CoreMicrobiome_Mycobacterium/99-coremicrobiome_presenceabsene_mycobacterium_investigation_20190903.png)

**Figure R27 | Alignment distribution and prevalence of Mycobacterium across well-preserved calculus microbiome samples in this study.** Approximate 'abundance' is consistent across calculus samples, however most prevalent taxa are likely well-known environmental taxa. a summary of alignments of well preserved samples and sources to _Mycobacterium_ species. b number of individuals that all _Mycobacterium_ species identified in the dataset are found in. Input is from MALT NCBI nt database OTU table at species level, excluding putative laboratory contaminants and badly preserved samples.

---

We noted that the taxa being picked up with MALT were indeed highly prevelent
soil contaminants that are typically waterborne, and we therefore concluded
this was likely derived from taphonomic causes.

#### R10.1.6 Core Microbiome Intersection Between Hosts

To assist in the interpretation of results, we wanted to create a visualisation
to efficiently summarise the number of taxa associated with the core of each
host combination.

Due to the large number of categories, the typically used Venn diagrams become
difficult to understand due to the inclusion of many layers of overlapping
combinations.  Instead, we summarised the number of taxa in each host via an
'UpSet' plot. Code for this can also be seen in the noteboom
`02-scripts.backup/018-CoreMicrobiome_ParameterTesting_20190902.Rmd`.

---

![Core microbiome Upset plots at genus and species level for Nt and RefSeq databases](05-images/Figure_R28_SFC_CoreMicrobiome_UpSetPlots/FigureSXX-CoreMicrobiome_UpSetR_combined.png)

**Figure R28 | UpSet plot showing the number of taxa shared across each host genus combination for NCBI nt (top) and custom NCBI RefSeq (bottom) and genus (left) and species (right).** Note that for the custom RefSeq database plots, a control group as a 'core' microbiome is displayed as at the corresponding minimum support value. However these taxa remain unique to the control samples only, which does not exist at the same threshold for the nt database. Plots are generated from MALT aligned and MEGAN exported OTU tables to each database; filtered for putative laboratory contaminants, badly preserved samples and a minimum support value for microbial taxa of 0.7 (genus level) and 0.4 (species level). Taxa are considered core to a host genus if taxon is present in 50% of individuals of each population, and >= 66% of the populations to a given host. Note the the difference between this figure and Figure 2 of the main manuscript is the retention here of _Mycobacterium_, which was excluded post-hoc (and thus excluded from Figure 2), and from subsequent the downstream core microbiome analysis, given that section R10.1.5 shows it is a pervasive likely contaminant.

---

The final list of taxa at both species and genus level that we estimated as
being core to each host group and combinations thereof, can also be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R22. Discussion of the core microbiomes
can be seen in the main text.

Additionally, we compared the core assignments between the two databases. These
comparisons were generated with
`02-scripts/18-CoreMicrobiome_database_Comparison`, and the outcome can be
seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R25.

Overall we found that core genera and species did exist across all host genera
in this study. These taxa span all layers of the known biofilm structure in
modern human calculus, suggesting a highly conserved structural core across
deep time. See main publication for further discussion.

### R10.2 Core Microbiome MaltExtract

To further verify the authenticity of the ancient nature of the core microbiome
assignments in the calculus samples - we also ran MaltExtract on a subset of
the core taxa to check for damage patterns and short fragment lengths
characteristic of ancient DNA.

We took the species level 'core' of the Hominids/Alouatta, Hominids and Homininis
based on the MALT nt database (as estimated above - i.e. with a min. support
value of 0.04, requiring a taxon being in 50% of each population having a taxon
to be core to the population, 66% of the populations to be core to the
genus, and retained single individual populations).

This list of taxa was then given to MaltExtract as follows,

```bash
MaltExtract \

been uploaded to the Github repository for MEx-IPA.

## R11 Genome Reconstruction and Phylogenetics

We next wanted to test whether the phylogenies of specific oral taxa also
'mimic' the phylogenetic histories of the host. A common problem from
genome construction from metagenomic sources - particularly with microbiome
data - is cross-mapping from related strains and species. This
makes genotyping difficult when dealing with the low coverage data, because
the confidence in the SNP calling is very low as variants of a position can
come from multiple 'conflicting' sources.

As a strategy to try and reduce cross-mapping, I came up with the idea to
map the production dataset to a 'super-reference' of all relevant species of
a genus (including the target species of interest), and then only genotype on
the section of the super-reference including the target species of interest. The
predicted effect would be reads from off-target genomes would be attracted to
the original related strains/species and thus would not be present on the
reference of interest itself.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R11.1 Production dataset sequencing depth calculations

For optimal phylogenetic reconstruction, high coverage genomes are generally
preferred to improve confidence in genotyping. The screening dataset
generally yields low coverage genomes, and we wanted to work out which samples
would provide the best chance of producing multiple higher-coverage genomes of
species of interest.

To calculate this, we mapped to a range of taxa of interest (either from
observations in the dataset or from broad literature review). We selected
the following species - downloaded the reference or representative strains
from NCBI, and indexed as [above](#r43-bwa-indexing).

The Initial species that were selected and downloaded are:

- _Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum_
- _Treponema socranskii_ (only scaffolds)
- _Rothia dentocariosa_
- _Desulfobulbus_ sp. oral taxon 041 (<- only contigs)
  - For this selected the sp. oral taxon 041 assembly with the largest
    assembly size, Desulfobulbus sp. oral taxon 041 str. Dsb1-5.
  - Downloaded from the Genbank FTP server the contigs from here:
    [ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/403/865/GCA_000403865.1_Dsb1-5](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/403/865/GCA_000403865.1_Dsb1-5)
- _Fusobacterium nucleatum_
- _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus_
- _Streptococcus gordonii_
- _Treponema denticola_
- _Tannerella forsythia_
- _Treponema denticola_

We then mapped all our samples to the references listed above with EAGER, with
the parameters below.

```text

Age: Ancient
Treated Data: non-UDG
Pairment: Single End
Input is already concatenated (skip merging): Y

> :warning: EAGER results files are not included here due to large size

We initially tried running PreSeq, but (un)fortunately the library complexity
was too high and not enough duplicates were found in most of the mappings to
yield enough information for extrapolation of additional sequencing required.

Instead, we did a linear estimation in an spreadsheet. For this we took the
following steps.

1. Multiplying the current number of reads and depth coverage until target
   depth coverage is reached (5x)
2. Remove any mapping that required more >100 million reads
3. Remove any mapping with a 'cluster factor'
   (reads before mapped deduplication / mapped reads after deduplication)
   above 1.2 - suggesting lower complexity library
4. Select any individual with at least 3 mappings retained above above filtering
   (if a host genus did not have enough samples, we went with the next highest
   number of mappings), with a target sample size of 3 individuals per host
   group.

Extracts of the selected samples were sent for UDG treatment and deep
sequencing for the majority of downstream phylogenetic and genome-level
functional analysis analysis.

### R11.2 Super-reference construction

Now with the deep sequenced subset of individuals, we then decided to select
taxa of the Hominid/Alouatta core microbiome we calculated
[above](#r1015-core-microbiome-intersection-between-hosts). We made the
assumption these taxa would be more likely to yield enough mappings
across all host genera in this study  sufficient for phylogenetic analysis
across the Hominid evolutionary history.

To assess whether we could reduce the number of multi-allelic positions caused
by cross-mapping, we first generated a super-reference for each genus,
as described in the the notebook
`02-scripts.backup/99-phylogeny_reference_genome_collection.Rmd`.

This notebook downloads the NCBI Genome assembly reports, performs filtering
based on sequencing level, quality, whether it is representative or not - and
selects one strain for species within the genus. Multi-chromosome or contig
assemblies were also collapsed into single entry.

Within the notebook we also performed more manual filtering of isolation source
to remove species that are very unlikely derived from the human body or in
contact with archaeological samples (such as activated sludge).

The outcome of these filtering steps can be seen in the files
`00-documentation.backup/18-Core_Microbiome_AssemblyDownload_*`, with the final
files used for downloading ending with  "\*filtered". These files were
downloaded as above with `wget`.

You can alternatively see a list of all genomes downloaded for each
super-reference in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R26.

We converted the FASTA headers to a format suitable for `samtools` and
`bedtools` (i.e. replace entries with entire species names, rather than
'chromosome' IDs) with
`02-scripts.backup/099-fasta_header_replacer.sh <FASTA>`.

Then, for certain aspects of downstream processing (in particular
MultiVCFAnalyzer), we needed to convert the multiple FASTA files into a single
one, with FASTA headers removed. For this we used the script
`02-scripts.backup/099-collapse_fastas.sh`, which combines them, but exports
coordinates (also in bed format) indicating where each species FASTA entry is
present, in the combined super-reference FASTA.

FASTAs were indexed as [above](#r43-bwa-indexing)

### R11.3 Super-reference alignment and species selection

The production dataset was then mapped to each of the core genus
super-references with EAGER, with the following settings.

```text
Organism: Bacteria/Other
Age: Ancient
Treated Data: UDG
Pairment: Single End
Input is already concatenated (skip merging): Y

Reference: [listed above]
Name of mitochondrial chromosome: [none]

FastQC: Off
AdapterRemoval: Off
Mapping: BWA
  Seedlength: 32
  Max # diff: 0.1
  Qualityfilter: 0
  Filter unmapped: On
  Extract Mapped/Unmapped: Off
Complexity Estimation: Off
Remove Duplicates: DeDup
  Treat all reads as merged: On
Damage Calculation: On

```

The settings above in table format can be seen in `06-additional_data_files`
under Data R27.

> :warning: The EAGER mapping results files are not provided here due to their
> large size, other than the ReportTable files which is stored in the directory.
> `04-analysis/deep/eager/superreference_mapping/output`

To generate breadth and depth statistics for each species reference (see below)
in the super-reference we used `bedtools`, using the BED coordinates as
provided by the `02-scripts.backup/099-collapse_fastas.sh` for each species.

```bash
bedtools coverage -a 01-data/genomes/"$genus"/collapsed_"$genus"_superreference.bed -b "$BAM" | pigz -p 1 > "$BAM".bedtoolsbreadth.tsv.gz
bedtools coverage -a 01-data/genomes/"$genus"/collapsed_"$genus"_superreference.bed -b "$BAM" -mean | pigz -p 1 > "$BAM".bedtoolsdepth.tsv.gz
```

> This was adapted from a SLURM array script using `find` and should be adapted
> accordingly to your own system so that tha `BAM` variable covers all mapping
> deduplicated BAM files for each individual and super-reference

Output results for this statistics can also be see under
`04-analysis/deep/eager/superreference_mapping/output` or collated in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R28.

### R11.4 Comparative single reference mapping

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R11.4.1 Reference selection methods

While we now had a super-reference mapping, we needed to compare the whether
genotyping on the target-species region of a super-reference reduced
the number of multi-allelic SNPs when compared to genotyping with a single
reference genome

For this, we needed a single genome to compare to, however the presence/absence
based
[core microbiome analysis](#r1015-core-microbiome-intersection-between-hosts)
nor [heatmaps](#r93-hierarchical-clustering-heatmaps) above did not provide
much  information on the most optimal species to select for each core genus for
comparison (i.e. should we select _Streptococcus sanguinis_ or
_Streptococcus gordonii_? Which one has the higher coverage, in the most
samples across our host genera).

To select the best 'target' species to compared to, we used the depth and
coverage statistics for each species in each super-reference to calculate a
variety of metrics, across which we used to select the best fitting
species for the two requirements above. This is described in
`02-scripts.backup/031-superreferencemapped_genotyping_stats.Rmd`.

We did this via both 'visual inspection' of plots, and tried an
'automated' approach by selecting which taxon was top of the highest number of
the 5 metrics used (see notebook for both procedures).

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R11.4.1 Reference selection comparison and final selection

The selection based on the different metrics performed manually and via
an automated system was compared in `06-additional_data_files` under
Data R29. The list below in Table R9 showed high concordance with the visual
inspection, and therefore the visual taxon selection was used only when
there was not a clear 'winner' from the automated selection (e.g. _Selenomonas_)

The final list of selected taxa via visual inspection were as follows

- _Actinomyces_              - Actinomyces_dentalis_DSM_19115
- _Campylobacter_            - Campylobacter_gracilis
- _Capnocytophaga_           - Capnocytophaga_gingivalis_ATCC_33624
- _Corynebacterium_          - Corynebacterium_matruchotii_ATCC_14266
- _Fretibacterium_           - Fretibacterium_fastidiosum
- _Fusobacterium_            - Fusobacterium_hwasookii_ChDC_F206
- _Olsenella_                - Olsenella_sp_oral_taxon_807
- _Ottowia_                  - Ottowia_sp_oral_taxon_894
- _Porphyromonas_            - Porphyromonas_gingivalis_ATCC_33277
- _Prevotella_               - Prevotella_loescheii_DSM_19665_=_JCM_12249_=_ATCC_15930
- _Pseudopropionibacterium_  - Pseudopropionibacterium_propionicum_F0230a
- _Selenomonas_              - Selenomonas_sp_F0473
- _Streptococcus_            - Streptococcus_sanguinis_SK36
- _Tannerella_               - Tannerella_forsythia_92A2
- _Treponema_                - Treponema_socranskii_subsp_paredis_ATCC_35535

Output from the automated species selection can be seen in
`04-analysis/deep/competitive_mapping.backup/species_selection`. This is
also summarised in Table R9, and the majority call under the 'Selected'
column.

**Table R9 | Results of ‘automated’ super-reference species selection for downstream phylogenetic analysis.** Production dataset was mapped for each genus with EAGER to a combined reference of all species of the calculus microbiome core genome calculated above. Metrics were number of reads, breadth coverage, depth coverage, competitive mapping score, percentage of species reads over all genus reads. Species were then filtered those that had a number metrics that the species exceeded the genus mean plus standard deviation of the metric was more than 1. In cases of ties, either a named species or more complete genome reconstruction selected. In cases where unnamed species are the top candidate, either the next best taxon with an official name or where the isolation source was ‘oral cavity’ were selected.

The reference genomes of the selected taxa were then copied from the
[super-reference downloaded files](#r112-super-reference-construction),
and multiple chromosomes collapsed as again described in
`02-scripts.backup/99-phylogeny_reference_genome_collection.Rmd`.

EAGER was run again with the same settings for the
[Super-reference mapping](#r113-super-reference-alignment-and-species-selection),
but with the single
representative genome taxa FASTAs instead.

Summary plots of the single genome mappings can be seen under
`02-scripts.backup/099-SingleGenome_MappingStatistics_Summary.Rmd`. Corresponding

### R11.5 Performance of super-reference vs. single genome mapping

As the main target of this comparison of mapping strategies was to see if we
could reduce the level of cross-mapping that can cause problematic genotyping,
we needed a way of assessing the level of multi-allelic positions occur in each
mapping.

For this we used MultiVCFAnalyzer, which, when given a GATK UnifiedGenotyper
VCF file where the reference ploidy was ('fakely') set to 2, will report
the fraction of reads that hold an allele in 'heterozygous' sites (i.e.
positions where there is a possible reference and a possible alternative
allele - which is not expected in haploid bacteria).

We ran MultiVCFAnalyzer as follows for each reference species of the two
mapping strategies (in the case of the super-reference mapping, of the
'extracted' region of interest).

```bash
java -Xmx32g -jar MultiVCFanalyzer_0-87.jar \
NA \
"$FASTA" \
NA \
<OUTDIR> \
T \
30 \
2 \
0.9 \
0.1 \
NA \
<VCF_1> \
<VCF_2> \
<VCF_3>

```

We set `T` to turn on saving of the allele frequencies in the outputted SNP
Table, minimum coverage of 2 (to ensure at least two independent reads support
a call), a minimum fraction of reads required to have a base to be considered
a single-allelic reference or SNP call as 0.9, and a minimum of 0.1 (but below 0.9) to be considered heterozygous.

For super-reference mappings, we still needed to retrieve the statistics for
just the positions representing the target species of interest. We  used the
following script to extract these from the MultiVCFAnalyzer SNP table output.

```bash
for i in 04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/initial_single_genome/output/*; do
  species="$(basename $i)"
  genus="$(echo $species | cut -d_ -f 1)"
  Rscript 02-scripts.backup/036-generate_multiVCFanalyzer_subset_statistics_20190322.R \
  04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/superreference_mapping/output/"$genus"/ \
  04-analysis/deep/eager/superreference_mapping/references/"$genus"/collapsed_"$genus"_superreference.bed \
  "$species"
done
```

Output files can be seen under
`04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/superreference_mapping/output/`

> :warning: Only the snpStatistics files are provided here due to the large
> size of the other MultiVCFAnalyzer output files.

To compare the level of heterozygosity as reported in MultiVCFAnalyzer between
the two mapping strategies, we created the following R notebook:
`02-scripts.backup/032-multibasesites_mappingstrategycomparison_20190528.Rmd`.

A summary table of percentage of multi-allelic SNPs when running
MultiVCFAnalyzer using both mapping methods can be seen in
`06-additional_data_files` under Data R30. Graphical comparison can be seen
below in Figure R62.

---

![Comparison of multi-allelic SNPs between super-reference and single-genome mapping](05-images/Figure_R62_ZolfoPlots/multiallelicsnprate_singlevssuperreferencegenome_transformnone_20200125.png)

**Figure R62 | Comparison of the number of multi-allelic single nucleotide variants (SNPs) identified when using a single representative genome mapping strategy versus a multi-reference genome (super-reference) mapping approach.** Analysis was performed on selected abundant and prevalent species representatives of core Hominid/_Alouatta_ genera, using the production dataset. Multi-allelic SNPs are sites called with more than the expected 1 allele (given haploid bacteria) – indicating cross mapping from other strains or related species. To reduce the occurrence of these and improve phylogenetic power, mapping to multiple species of a genera (vs. the single representative) to attract away mis-mapping reads was attempted. Arrows indicate direction of change in the percentage of multi-allelic sites between single genome (grey circle outline) and super-reference (black circle outline) mapping strategies. The expected reduction in the percentage of multi-allelic SNPs (from right to left on the x-axis) between the two strategies is not observed to consistently occur and with minor effect. Furthermore, in most cases when a reduction occurs, these samples have already very few SNPs (size circles) usable for phylogenetic analysis.  Statistics are summarized from the ‘SNP statistics’ file from the output of MultiVCFAnalyzer with a ‘homozygous’ threshold of 0.9, a ‘heterozygous’ threshold of 0.1, and a minimum coverage threshold of 2.

> Note: the figure ID is out of order due to missing upload during initial writing of this walk-through.

---

From this script and in the figure above, we observed that the super-reference
mapping strategy did not work very often at reducing the number of
multi-allelic SNPs, and further often resulted in a large decrease in the
number of positions overall on the reference itself - therefore reducing the
phylogenetically-informative number of sites (see many publication for
more discussion). We therefore selected the single representative genome
mappings for downstream analysis to ensure maximal information for relationship
calculations.

Additionally, in the notebook we also show that we identified the most common
fraction of a majority allele in multi-allelic positions was 0.7. This allowed
us to identify optimal fraction parameter when dealing with multi-allelic SNPs
within MultiVCFAnalyzer, to boost the the number of semi-confident SNP
positions (by including majority-call alleles in phylogenetically useful
positions, under the assumptions majority calls derive from the target
species of interest).

Calculated by selecting for each single-genome mapping the highest frequency multi-allelic SNP bin, from the 'SNP Table' of MultiVCFAnalyzer with a 'homozygous' threshold of 0.9, and 'heterozygous' threshold of 0.1 and minimum coverage threshold of 2.

### R11.6 Variant calling and single-allelic position assessment

For final variant calling for phylogenetic analysis, we re-ran
MultiVCFAnalyzer to create our final SNP Alignments based on the single genome
reference mappings.

We ran the same MultiVCFAnalyzer command as above, but with the slightly
relaxed homozygous fraction parameter and turning off reporting of heterozygous
positions by setting the heterozygous parameter to the same as the homozygous.
Therefore we retained only 'confident' (not UPAC uncertainty) nucleotides in the
alignments.

```bash
java -Xmx32g -jar MultiVCFanalyzer_0-87.jar \
NA \
"$FASTA" \
NA \
04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/superreference_mapping/output/superreference_mapping_2X_0.7_0.7/"$SPECIES" \

### R11.7 Phylogenies

For the phylogenies themselves, I wrote a custom R script that allows for
generating a few summary statistics for the alignment, filtering based on
number of positions of an entry in the SNP alignment, and then
pairwise-deletion neighbour-joining phylogenies. See main publication for
justification behind the pairwise-deletion and NJ trees.

To ensure a enough positions are present for distance calculations between
samples we required a minimum of 1000 called positions for each sample, the
filtering of which is included in `02-scripts.backup/042-generate_NJ_tree.R`.

e.g.

```bash
## Initial Single Genomes
for i in 04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/initial_single_genome/output/initial_single_genome_2X_0.7_0.7/*/snpAlignment.fasta.gz; do
  echo "$i"
  Rscript 02-scripts.backup/042-generate_NJ_tree.R "$i" 1000 JC69 100 none
  echo ""
done

# 'cause Howlers are weird with P. gingivalis
Rscript 02-scripts.backup/042-generate_NJ_tree.R 04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/initial_single_genome/output/initial_single_genome_2X_0.7_0.7/Porphyromonas_gingivalis_ATCC_33277/snpAlignment.fasta.gz 2000 JC69 100 OME003
```

> We had to re-run _Porphyromonas_ with a higher minimum  position threshold,
> and excluded a sample. The higher position here was due to some samples having
> insufficient position overlap to calculate a genetic distance, and inclusion
> OME003 caused bootstrapping to fail as it had an unusually higher number of
> SNPs which ended up violating the equal base frequencies of the JC69 model.

The final Newick files and filtering statistics can be seen in
`04-analysis/deep/multivcfanalyzer/initial_single_genome/output/initial_single_genome_2X_0.7_0.7/`

Visualisation of the phylogenies were carried out with the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/026-Tree_visualisation_20190611.Rmd` and PDF files of each
phylogeny for each of the taxa under `04-analysis/deep/phylogenies/plots` and
combined below.

We selected the 8 best supported phylogenies at the deepest nodes of the tree,
i.e. where the nodes representing the divergence of the host-genera had
bootstrap values >=70%.

**Figure R31 | Neighbour joining trees of eight well-supported calculus core taxa trees from single representative mappings of the production dataset.** Trees generally show microbial strains clustering of individuals to those of the same host genus, and pre-14k BP European individuals consistently display a distinct clade from post-14k BP European individuals. Representative genomes were selected based on abundance and prevalence across all individuals in production dataset. SNPs were called using MultiVCFAnalyzer with a minimum coverage threshold of 2, and the majority allele threshold of 0.7. Alignments with <1000 called SNPs were removed. Genetic distance calculated using the ape R package, with the Jukes-Cantor 69 model and pairwise deletion strategy for missing data. Bootstraps are out of 100 bootstraps. Trees were selected as 'well-supported' if nodes resulting in expected host genus bifurcations equalled or exceeded 70%. Note that titles refer to the representative genome of the selected species used for the reference genome, and the alignments are mixtures of strains/species as indicated by high levels of multi-allelic sites. Grey boxes indicate European 'pre-14k BP' of the Red Lady of El Mirón and Neanderthals.

**Figure R32 | Relationship between number of positions shared, and fold depth coverage between pairwise combinations of individuals, from the production dataset mapped to representative core taxa. Higher coverage taxa generally display greater numbers of shared positions.** Shared number of bases was calculated from the MultiVCFAnalyzer 'SNP alignment' FASTA file, with alignments containing less than 1000 bases removed. Order of microbial taxa and fill colour based on the genus median of average fold coverages average across all mappings in that genus as reported by EAGER. Boxplots present 25%, 50%, 75% of data, Dots represent outliers as calculated by the geom_histogram() function of ggplot. X axis is log scaled.

---

Overall we saw a general concordance whereby strains from the same host genera
clustered together, but the relationships between these clades did not match
the phylogenetic relationships between the hosts. See main publication for
further discussion on the interpretation of the trees topologies.

### R11.8 Pre- and Post-14k BP Observation Verification

In the trees generated above, we also observed that single deep sequenced
pre-14ky BP individual (Red Lady/EMN001) _always_ clustered with Neanderthals,
whereas post-14ky BP individuals mostly fell with modern day humans.

#### R11.8.1 Production dataset overlapping positions analysis

One possible cause of this clustering could be that the two clades could
represent different species (due to sub-optimal reference selection), and
therefore the clustering of the Red Lady of El Mirón (EMN001) with the
Neanderthals is because they share the same regions of the genome, which are
not present in the other clade (leading to more similar distance calculations).
Alternatively, the Neanderthals and EMN001 may have very small regions of the
genome covered (given their age) and the distance calculated is just highly
conserved regions with low diversity.

To check this, we built a distribution of the numbers of positions
present in both of of all pair-wise combinations of humans individuals. Then we
can calculated the median number of overlapping SNPs of EMN001 with each
Neanderthals, and the same for each human individual - and see if the
EMN001/Neanderthal median fell outside the range of the EMN001/Human and
Human/Human combinations.

This is implemented in 'Version three' within the R notebook
`02-scripts.backup/044-SNPAlignment_SharedData_Analysis_20190915.Rmd`.

</p>

**Figure R33 | Comparison of number shared positions of EMN001 and Neanderthals, compared to humans used to generate production dataset phylogenies.** EMN001 and Neanderthal pairwise combinations do not show having shared number of positions falling outside the range of all human to human pairwise combinations. Histogram represents a count of all pairwise human combinations that have a given number of shared positions. All individuals with less than 1000 positions in each SNP alignment have been removed. Orange solid line represents median number of positions of EMN001 shared with each human, and red dashed line represents median shared between EMN001 and each Neanderthal individual.

---

The output files for can be seen in `04-analysis/deep/phylogenies/` with files
starting with `SharedSNP*`.

Overall we observed Neanderthals did not have any more or less SNP positions
than other human combinations, suggesting clustering is not due to conserved
or reconstruction of the wrong species genome used in the SNP alignment.

#### R11.8.2 Screening datasets phylogenies

We also wanted to see if this clustering of the pre-14ky individual with
Neanderthals held when adding additional European individuals, which was not
available in the deep sequencing dataset.

For this, we attempted building the same phylogenies but with the screening
counterparts of each sample (i.e. with damage, and lower coverage), with a
few extra individuals i.e. PLV001 and RIG001 for pre-14ky BP, and OFN001 for
post-14ky BP. While even though this would result in even _lower_ resolution
phylogenies compared the already simplified neighbour-joining trees,
corroboration of topology (even if with lower bootstrap) could support a true
biological signal regarding the observed pattern.

We set up EAGER the same way as
[above](#r111-production-dataset-sequencing-depth-calculations)
(retaining the stricter alignment parameters to try and reduce the effect of
damage).

Once completed, we checked the coverage statistics of each EAGER run as in
`02-scripts.backup/056-Phylogenies_Screening_EMNCheck_EAGERResults.Rmd`.
The individual ReportTables can be seen in
`04-analysis/screening/EMN_Neanderthal_phylogeny_check/multivcfanayzer/output`.
Although coverage was low overall, we tried to build phylogenies anyway.

> :warning: The EAGER mapping results files are not provided here due to their
large size other than the ReportTable files.

We again ran MultiVCFAnalyzer with the same parameters above, but to a new
directory.

```bash
java -Xmx32g -jar MultiVCFanalyzer_0-87.jar \
NA \
"$FASTA" \
NA \

T \
30 \

0.7 \

<VCF_1> \
<VCF_2> \

```

Then same as above, we attempted to recreate the same 8 better-supported
deep sequenced data phylogenies with:

```bash
for i in 04-analysis/screening/EMN_Neanderthal_phylogeny_check/multivcfanalyzer/output/*/snpAlignment.fasta.gz; do
  echo "$i"
  Rscript 02-scripts.backup/042-generate_NJ_tree.R "$i" 1000 JC69 100 none
  echo ""
done
```

---

In general we saw, albeit at lower resolution, similar patterns where the
pre-14ky individuals still fell with the Neanderthal individuals, while the
post-14k individuals fell with other ancient and/or modern humans.

## R12 Functional Analysis

In addition to taxonomic relationships in the calculus microbiomes of each host
genus we wanted to explore overall _functional_ differences, and also more to
see if we could traces changes virulence factors of what is typically
considered 'pathogenic' red complex taxa (but is increasingly being shown to
be either opportunistic commensals or having many commensal relatives) over
the evolution of Hominids.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R12.1 Virulence Factors

Given that we identified in the production dataset significant numbers of reads
mapping to reference genomes of well-studied 'red complex' species, classically
considered pathogens, across most host genera, we were interested to see if we
would observe any change in the pathogenicity based on gain/loss of identified
virulence factors in human strains.

For this we used the production mapping datasets to the references of
_Tannerella forsythia_ and _Porphyromonas gingivalis_.

We took the deduplicated bedfiles and run `bedtools` coverage on them, using
a collection of virulence factors described in the literature. This list
including NCBI gene locus tags can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under
Data R35.

```bash
bedtools coverage -a <REFERENCE>.gff -b <BAM> > <OUT FILE>.tsv
bedtools coverage -a <REFERENCE>.gff -b <BAM> > <OUT FILE>.tsv -mean
```

For the actual filtering of individuals with overall genomic low coverage (i.e.
retaining individuals that had sufficient coverage that we could say with
reasonable confidence of a true presence- or absence - Figure R35) and the
actual identification of presence/absence of these genes, we loaded the
resulting TSV files into R with the notebook
 `02-scripts.backup/054-virulence_investigation.Rmd`.

---

![Number of genes passing breadth coverage thresholds for red complex production-data mappings](05-images/Figure_R35_SFE_VirulenceFactors_GeneFiltering/FigSX_VirulenceNormalisation_Breadth_GeneFilter.png)

**Figure R35 | Distribution of (annotated) gene counts passing a breadth threshold of 70%, as calculated from the mappings of the production dataset to two 'red complex' bacteria reference genomes.** A clear cut off of ~500 genes can be seen, reflecting the separation between low-coverage and higher coverage genomes.

---

For _Tannerella forsythia_ we saw that most virulence factors were present
within most individuals of the deep sequenced dataset, whereas there was
more variation in in _P. gingivalis_, with the Mfa family of fimbrae genes
seemingly missing in _Alouatta_ and _Pan_.

### R12.2 Amylase

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R12.2.1 Streptococcus Distribution

In the hierarchical clustering ([above](#r93-hierarchical-clustering-heatmaps)),
we observed the relative abundance and prevalence of streptococci varied between
host genus. We therefore wished to explore this further - given the interest
in human evolutionary history regarding the role of amylase copy number
variation (see main publication for an overview), and certain groups of
streptococci displaying amylase-binding activity.

Firstly, we looked at the distribution of different types of streptococci groups
within each of our host genera. We generated a 'consensus' table of streptococci
groups and their reported amylase-binding protein activity (as reported in the
literature), described here in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R33 or
under `00-documentation.backup/25-streptococcus_cladegroup_amylasegroup_database.tsv`.

Using the MALT species level OTU tables from the screening dataset, we
visualised as stacked bar plots the proportion of _Streptococcus_ alignments
deriving from each group (Figure R64). We can also applied the same concept to the production
dataset - but using the _Streptococcus_ super-reference as the reference
database (Figure R37), as in the notebook
`02-scripts.backup/033-streptoccocus_investigation_v2_20190826.Rmd`.

---

![Distribution of reads across streptococci species for screening dataset mapping to NCBI nt database with MALT](05-images/Figure_R64_RawFig5_MALTAmylaseStrepDistribution/01-streptococcusinvestigation_stackedbar_nt_0.04_hostgenus_percentagegroupoverallstrepreads_cladeconsensus_20190827.png)

**Figure R64 | Distribution of screening dataset assignments to each _Streptococcus_ group when mapping to a the NCBI nt database with MALT, normalised by the total number of MALT assignments to all Streptococci** Stacked bar plot of proportion of alignments to different Streptococcus groups show differences between host genera. Proportion is calculated over all streptococci reads as identified using MALT to the NCBI nt database (at species level after low abundance removal of taxa with ≤ 0.04% of all alignments). One Gorilla was removed, as it had no signal of Streptococcus. Individuals ordered by population/time period, except Homo individuals resembling Pan. Amylase-binding activity has been observed among members of the Sanguinis, Mitis and Salivarius groups.

![Distribution of reads across streptococci species for production dataset mapping to super-reference](05-images/Figure_R37_SED_StreptococcusGroupDistributionSuperreference/01-streptococcusinvestigation_stackedbar_superreference_none_hostgenus_percentagegroupoverallstrepreads_cladeconsensus_20190920.png)

**Figure R37 | Distribution of production dataset reads to each Streptococcus group when mapping to a Streptococcus super-reference, normalised by the total number of _Streptococcus_ aligned reads.** As with the screening dataset, _Homo_ are dominated by streptococci groups displaying amylase binding protein activity (sangiuinis, mitis and salivarius). See section 6. Microbial phylogenetics for details on super-reference construction and mapping. Streptococcus groups are ordered by amylase activity as reported by Haase 2017 BMC Microbiol - in which members within the sanguinis, mitis and salivarius groups showed amylase activity.

---

In both the screening and deep sequencing datasets, we observed that _Homo_
had greater fractions of alignments to streptococci that have been empirically
shown to display amylase-binding activity compared to other host genera
(although also with a greater level of overall streptococci reads aligning to
untested taxa in the non-_Homo_ hosts)

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

#### R12.2.2 Amylase binding protein genes abundance

Given the different distributions of the _Streptococcus_ content of each
host genus, and the observation that Humans tend to have more prominent signals
of amylase-binding activity-positive species, we also looked at whether amylase-
binding genes could actually be detected within each host genus.

We decided to use the production dataset for this, as it would provide higher
confidence that a gene is present, given the higher whole-depth depth
coverages in this dataset. Given that sections of amylase-binding protein B
(_abpB_) sequence are present in other genes (and variants in other species), we
also wanted to find all possible 'amylase-binding-protein gene'-like sequences
in the super-reference. So as to maximise our sensitivity in finding reads
 putatively deriving from the actual amylase binding protein gene.

For this we recovered all amylase-like reads from our _Streptococcus_
super-reference with the tool panX, using the Genbank files for each
reference.

```bash
## Run panX analysis
pan-genome-analysis/panX.py \
-fn <GENBANK_FILE_DIR> \
-sl Streptococcus_Superreference \
-t 32
```

Plugging the output into the panX visualisation companion tool (see the panX
[documentation](https://github.com/neherlab/pan-genome-visualization/), we
searched for the _abpA_ and _abpB_ genes as annotated in the well-annotated
_Streptococcus gordonii_ genome, and downloaded the corresponding FASTA
alignments of similar sequences from the sequence alignment table. The
alignments can be seen under
`04-analysis/screening/streptococcus_investigation.backup/panX/abpA_abpB_cluster_alignments`.

We then performed a filtering procedure to the files due to
the inclusion of highly diverged sequences (as we ran panX on default settings),
as described in
`02-scripts.backup/048-panX_streptococcus_amylasebindingproteincluster_detection.Rmd`.
The final list of annotations can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under
Data R34.

We then used the R script `02-scripts.backup/049-Streptoccocus_superreference_amylasebinding_coordinate_reconstruction.R`
to recover the coordinates of these sequences from the super-reference FASTA,
which was exported as a BED file.

> :warning: The super-reference FASTA files are not included here to large size.

For each sample's mapping to the _Streptococcus_ super-reference, we then
ran bedtools to recover statistics on the coverage of each annotated gene
entry.

```bash
## Extract reads from abpA and abpB-like regions
bedtools intersect \
-c \
-a <ABPA_OR_ABPB_BEDFILE> \
-b <SUPER-REFERENCE_BAM>
```

The resulting files were then loaded into to assess the ratio of all
_Streptococcus_ reads to amylase binding protein-like reads as in
`02-scripts.backup/051-streptococcus_superreference_to_amylase_comparison.Rmd`.
The distributions can be seen in Figure R65.

We observed that calculated ratios were much higher in _Homo_ (with
Neanderthals falling within the range of humans for abpB) than other primates.
See the main publication for the implications of this. This was also
statistically confirmed with Mann-Whitney U tests (see R notebook), which were
also compared to a distribution of p-values of 100 random shuffle of group
assignments (see Figure R63 below).

**Figure R65 | Ratios of reads aligning to amylase-binding-protein annotated sequences versus a ‘super-reference’ of  166 Streptococcus assemblies show higher values in Homo than non-human primates.** Distributions based on a deep-sequenced subset of samples and four present-day humans. Note the ratio on the Y axes of abpA and abpB are scaled differently due to the greater number of abpB-like sequences in the super-reference and therefore more reads are likely to be retrieved.

#### R12.2.3 Amylase bayesian skyline analysis

Given this pattern, we were interested if we could infer any more information
about the evolutionary history of these genes.

We therefore identified reads in the screening dataset originating from
specifically the *abpA* and *abpB* genes by independently using BLAST and mapping
against a selected set of reference sequences of *abpA* and *abpB*.

All reference _abpA_ sequences in fasta format were built into a blast database:

```bash
makeblastdb -in <abp_gene>.fasta -dbtype nucl -title <abp_gene> -out <abp_gene>
```

and then all screening samples were searched against both databases using
blast command line tools:

```bash
## ran once with <abp_database> for abpA and again with <abp_database> for abpB
gzip -dcf <SAMPLENAME>.fastq.gz | blastn -db <abp_database> -query - -out $(basename <SAMPLENAME> .fasta.gz).out -num_descriptions 20 -num_alignments 20 -num_threads 12
```

All reads that hit any reference sequence were extracted from a blast format
output file to a list using the script `ncbiblastparser.pl` downloaded
from `https://github.com/mel-astar/mel-ngs/blob/master/utils/ncbiblastparser.pl`

```bash
ncbiblastparser.pl <(gzip -dcf <SAMPLENAME>.out) 1 "$(echo <SAMPLENAME>)".parsed
grep -v 'No hits found' "$(echo <SAMPLENAME>)".parsed > "$(echo <SAMPLENAME>)".hits
```

The read ID of all sequences with a hit in the blast output were copied to a
list

```bash
awk '{print $1}' <SAMPLENAME>.hits > <SAMPLENAME>.list
```

This list was used to extract the reads from the original fastq files using
seqtk into new files to be mapped against *apbA* and *abpB* references
sequences:

```bash
zcat <SAMPLENAME>.fastq.gz | seqkit grep -f <SAMPLENAME>.list > <SAMPLENAME>.fastq
```

The individual *abpA* and *abpB* sequences used for the BLAST database were then
indexed with bwa for mapping:

```bash
for f in *.fasta; do
  bwa index -p `basename $f .fasta` $f
done
```

Each BLAST-hit read sample file was mapped against each *abpA* and *abpB*
reference sequence:

```bash
bwa aln -n 0.01 -l 32 <reference_abp_sequence> <SAMPLENAME>.fastq > <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sai

bwa samse <reference_abp_sequence> <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sai <SAMPLENAME> > <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sam
```

Finally files were converted to bam format, mapped reads selected out,
duplicate reads removed from the mapped read only file, and the
duplicate-removed mapped-only read file was indexed with the following
procedure:

```bash

# convert sam to bam
for f in *.sam; do
  samtools view -bS $f | samtools sort - $(basename $f .sam).bam
done

# select only mapped reads
for f in *.bam; do
  samtools view -b -F4 $f > $(basename $f .bam).mapped.bam
done

# remove duplicates from mapped reads
for f in *mapped.bam; do
  samtools rmdup -s $f $(basename $f .bam)_rmdup.bam 2>&1 >/dev/null  | cut -d' ' -f 6 > $(basename $f .bam)_dup.txt # collects read IDs of the duplicate reads
  samtools index $(basename $f .bam)_rmdup.bam
done

# index the mapped, dupliate-removed bam files
for f in *rmdup.bam; do
  samtools index $f $(basename $f .bam).bai
done
```

We performed additional mapping using looser parameters to see if we picked up
additional reads mapping to either *apbA* or *abpB* that were missed with our
standard mapping parameters. This way we were able to make sure we were not
missing variation in the genes due to evolutionary changes, particularly in the
non-*Homo* groups. We counted the number of reads that mapped to each reference
sequence in each sample, and compared it to the number that mapped using
standard paremeters. We found that there were no more than 2 additional reads
mapped per reference sequence per sample, and in no cases did this bring
coverage to >40%.

```bash
bwa aln -n 5 -l 1000 <reference_abp_sequence> <SAMPLENAME>.fastq > <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sai

bwa samse <reference_abp_sequence> <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sai <SAMPLENAME> > <SAMPLENAME>.abp_reference_seqence.sam

# convert sam to bam
for f in *.sam; do
  samtools view -bS $f | samtools sort - $(basename $f .sam).bam
done

# select only mapped reads
for f in *.bam; do
  samtools view -b -F4 $f > $(basename $f .bam).mapped.bam
done

# remove duplicates from mapped reads
for f in *mapped.bam; do
  samtools rmdup -s $f $(basename $f .bam)_rmdup.bam 2>&1 >/dev/null  | cut -d' ' -f 6 > $(basename $f .bam)_dup.txt # collects read IDs of the duplicate reads
  samtools index $(basename $f .bam)_rmdup.bam
done

# index the mapped, dupliate-removed bam files
for f in *rmdup.bam; do
  samtools index $f $(basename $f .bam).bai
done

# count the # of mapped, non-duplicate reads
for f in *rmdup.bam; do
samtools view $f | wc -l
done
```

All alignments from mapping with the standard parameters (-n 0.01 -l 32) were
visually inspected with IGV, and consensus sequences from mapping against the
*Streptococcus gordonii* str. Challis (NC_009785) reference *abpA* and *abpB*
sequences were exported from IGV if they covered at least 40% of the reference
at least 1X. To do this, on the alignment track we right-clicked to bring up a
menu and select 'Copy consensus sequence'. All consensus sequences were then
pasted into a text file in fasta format that included the NC_009785 reference
sequence, and this was used as an alignment file. The consensus sequence fasta
file was uploaded to Geneious v 8.0.5 and exported in a nexus file format.

The consensus sequence nexus file was uploaded into BEAUTi, for Bayesian
skyline analysis with BEAST2 v 2.4.7., and dates were added, either as estimated
from archaeological context (see main publication and extended data ), or from
known collection dates of modern data. All parameters were left at default with
the GTR substitution model, a strict clock, and coalescent Bayesian skyline
model. The MCMC chain length was 800,000,000 with sampling every 80,000 states.

While the chain converged, inspection of the tree structure in DensiTree showed
no structure for *abpA*, and we therefore did not proceed with BEAST analysis
to attempt to date expansion of *abpA*. However, we generated a skyline plot
from the *abpB* data, which is shown in Figure R38.

A list of accession numbers of abpB sequences collected for bayesian skyline
analysis can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R36.

**Figure R38 | Bayesian skyline plot of population expansion of the amylase-binding protein B gene (_abpB_).** The population shows expansion at ~7000 years before the present, with a decline at around 500 years before the present. However, the uneven distribution of samples across time make the results unreliable, and we do not draw any conclusions from these results.

Due to low and uneven sample sizes, we were unable to draw confident
conclusions from these results.

### R12.3 HUMANn2

In addition to the taxonomic profile, the functional profile of dental calculus
microbiota may provide insight into host evolutionary patterns. The functional
profile of a metagenomic sample is determined by the gene content of species
that are present. The program HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network 2 (HUMAnN2,
Franzosa, *et al*. 2018) was developed to generate a metabolic functional
profile from a metagenome sample. HUMAnN2 provides both species-specific gene
assignments and general gene assignments, when the species of origin cannot be
determined, as well as grouping the genes into the metabolic pathways they
contribute to and providing a metabolic pathway profile. We assessed both the
metabolic pathway profile and the gene content profile of our samples generated
by HUMAnN2, as detailed below.

for LIBFILE in "$INDIR"/*/*bowtie2out.txt; do
  LIBNAME=$(echo "$LIBFILE" | rev | cut -d/ -f2 | rev)
  if [ -d "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME" ]; then
    printf "\n $LIBNAME already Processed \n\n"
  else
    mkdir "$OUTDIR"/"$LIBNAME"
    metaphlan2.py $LIBFILE \
    -o $OUTDIR/$LIBNAME/$LIBNAME.mp2profile_readsmappedstats.tsv \
    --input_type bowtie2out \
    --nproc 2 \
    -t reads_map
  fi
done
```

To merge all of the MetaPhlAn2 percentage profiles of all the libraries we
then did the following.

```bash
cd 04-analysis/screening/metaphlan2/output

## Note, remove metaphlan2.py script in the variable here as using util scripts
METAPHLAN2=biobakery-metaphlan2-7898bf1/

INDIR=04-analysis/screening/metaphlan2/input
OUTDIR=04-analysis/screening/metaphlan2/output

"$METAPHLAN2"/utils/merge_metaphlan_tables.py "$OUTDIR"/*/*mp2profile.tsv > "$OUTDIR"/mp2_merged_abundance_table_all_"$(date +%Y%m%d)".txt
```

For merging of the estimated read count files, we ran the
`016-metaphlan2_readcount_table_generator.Rmd` notebook.

For merging of the 'mapped reads method', the output actually gave both the
name of the read and a given taxonomic ID. To merge we thus ran:

```bash

for i in */*; do
  echo $(echo "$i" | cut -d "/" -f 1) $(zcat "$i" | wc -l) ;
done > mp2_merged_readsmapped_table_all_"$(date +%Y%m%d)".txt

```

Note that all of those files needed to be -1 because the count included a
header.

> :warning: Individual MetaPhlAn2 files are not provided here due to redundancy
with combined file(s)

The summarised output MetaPhlAn2 files can be seen in `06-additional_data_files`
under Data R15.

Finally, some read statistics by applying the same 0.01% threshold used in MALT
were gained via the `099-MetaPhlan2_Summary_statistics.R` script. These were
then manually added to the main analysis metadata file (Data R04 in
`06-additional_data_files`).

The numbers of reads with taxonomic assignment were across all taxa, as
expected from a) the marker-gene profiling approach used by MetaPhlAn2 and
b) ancient samples with large amounts of 'unknown' environmental contamination.
Interestingly, the level of reads identified in Plaque samples was much more
high and consistent than all other groups.

#### R12.3.2 Running HUMANn2

Once we had the MetaPhlAn2 profiles, we ran run HUMAnN2 with the following
command.

> :warning: The following was adapted from a SLURM array script and should be
adjusted accordingly to run on each sample

```bash

humann2 \
--input <INPUT_SAMPLE>.fq.gz \
--output 04-analysis/screening/humann2/output/"$SAMPLENAME"/  \
--taxonomic-profile <INPUT_MP2_PROFILE>.tsv \
--threads 8 \
--memory-use maximum

```

:warning: The output temporary files (which don't appear to be removed) are
HUGE. We removed them after successful running by doing the following:

```bash
cd 04-analysis/screening/humann2/output
rm -r */*_temp/
```

which reduced our footprint from 4.9 TERABYTES(!?!?!) down to 3.9 gigabytes.
This is mostly due to the uncompressed SAM files.

Next we needed to normalise the data of each file. We only needed
to do this on the 'genefamilies' and 'pathabundance' data, as you don't have to
do this for the [pathwaycoverage](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/humann2#rst-header-manipulating-humann2-output-tables)

```bash

cd 04-analysis/screening/humann2/output

for SAMPLE in */*_genefamilies.tsv; do
    humann2_renorm_table --input $SAMPLE --output ${SAMPLE%.tsv}_cpm.tsv --units cpm --update-snames
done

for SAMPLE in */*_pathabundance.tsv; do
    humann2_renorm_table --input $SAMPLE --output ${SAMPLE%.tsv}_cpm.tsv --units cpm --update-snames
done

rm */*_genefamilies.tsv
rm */*_pathabundance.tsv

# -s to search subdirectories of current directory to look for the files
humann2_join_tables --input . --output humann2_genefamilies.tsv --file_name genefamilies_cpm -s
humann2_join_tables --input . --output humann2_pathcoverage.tsv --file_name pathcoverage -s
humann2_join_tables --input . --output humann2_pathabundance.tsv --file_name pathabundance_cpm -s

```

We also wanted to put the output in KEGG format. To do this we firstly
downloaded the re-grouping database

```bash
humann2_databases --download utility_mapping full 01-data/databases/humann2

```

And then regrouped our table(s) accordingly

```bash
humann2_regroup_table -i humann2_pathabundance.tsv -g uniref90_ko -o humann2_pathabundance_ko.tsv
humann2_regroup_table -i humann2_genefamilies.tsv -g uniref90_ko -o humann2_genefamilies_ko.tsv
```

> :warning: HUMANn2 output files are not provided here due to large size

All in-depth analysis and figure generation for HUMAnN2 data can be found in the
R markdown document here
`02-scripts.backup/144-imv-oral_evolution_humann2_fxn_cleaned.Rmd`. However,
a brief overview with figures can be seen here.

We used pathway abundance data to perform PCAs, which were plotted to visualize
the relationships between samples and controls, as well as within and between
samples. The samples that plotted with controls, except plaque, were removed as
outliers with poor preservation (File R37).

We used KEGG ortholog abundance data to perform PCAs, which were plotted to
visualize the relationships between samples and controls, as well as within and
between samples. The samples that plotted with controls, except plaque, were
removed as outliers with poor preservation (File R37).

Biplots were used to visualize the KEGG orthologs with strongest loadings in PC1
and PC2, to understand what drives separation of sample groups. The table with
these loadings is File R38.

Note in panels b and d (without present-day _Homo_ samples) that the y-axis has been reversed to maintain orientation with the other PCAs.

---

The abundance of each of the orthologs plotted in the biplots above were
visualized in heat maps to visualize the difference between host groups,
including modern _Homo_ samples.

---

visualized in heat maps to visualize the difference between host groups,
excluding modern _Homo_ samples.

---

We looked at whether specific species contributed the orthologs with strongest
loadings in the biplots above to look for host-specific species contributions to
orthologs. First we looked at the orthologs in strongest positive loadings in
PC1.

---

---

We looked at whether specific species contributed the orthologs with strongest
loadings in the biplots above to look for host-specific species contributions to
orthologs. Then we looked at the orthologs in strongest negative loadings in PC1.

---

![HUMAnN2 PC1 negative ortholog barplots](05-images/Figure_R41-R51-SM_R52-R61-SN_Functional_analyses/R41-R51_SM_humann2/R41-R51_SM_Composite_figures/R48_SM8_supplemental_humann2_KO_bars_PC1_neg.png)

---

We looked at whether specific species contributed the orthologs with strongest
loadings in the biplots above to look for host-specific species contributions to
orthologs. Then we looked at the proteins in strongest PC2 loadings
characterizing non-human primates.

---

![HUMAnN2 PC2 positive ortholog barplots](05-images/Figure_R41-R51-SM_R52-R61-SN_Functional_analyses/R41-R51_SM_humann2/R41-R51_SM_Composite_figures/R49_SM9_supplemental_humann2_KO_bars_PC2_pws.png)

---

We looked at whether specific species contributed the orthologs with strongest
loadings in the biplots above to look for host-specific species contributions to
orthologs. Last we looked at the proteins in strongest PC2 loadings
characterizing _Homo_.

---

![HUMAnN2 PC2 negative ortholog biplots](05-images/Figure_R41-R51-SM_R52-R61-SN_Functional_analyses/R41-R51_SM_humann2/R41-R51_SM_Composite_figures/R50_SM10_supplemental_humann2_KO_bars_PC2_neg.png)

---

Lastly, we looked at whether KEGG orthologs in specific metabolic pathways were
as distinct between host groups as all KEGG orthologs combined, by performing
and plotting PCAs with KEGG orthologs from only the Carbohydrate, Amino acid,
and Lipid metabolic pathways independently.

---

### R12.4 AADDER Analysis

As a validation, we also used AADDER (bundled with MEGAN6) - a tool which
infers functional characteristics based on the annotations of a MALT/MEGAN
reference database.

This uses `.gff` files to compare taxonomic assignments with annotations, which
we downloaded [above](#r42-aadder-database). A list of genomes used in this list
can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under Data R10.

We ran this against the custom RefSeq genomes we built above both
with MALT (fasta files) and AADDER (gff files).

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R12.5 MALT RefSeq

We then ran MALT but instead of immediately producing RMA6 files, we
generated SAM files. This was performed by running the following:

```bash
02-scripts.backup/008-malt-genbank-refseq_bacarchhomo_gcs_20181122_4step_85pc_supp_0.01 \
04-analysis/screening/malt/temp_input/*/*.fq.gz \
04-analysis/screening/malt/refseq_bacarchhomo_gcs_20181122/
```

To extract the summary statistics for the Refseq runs, we can ran
the following on the MALT logs.

```bash
grep -e "Loading MEGAN File:" \
-e "Total reads:" \
-e "With hits:" \
-e "Alignments:" \
-e "Assig. Taxonomy" \
-e "Min-supp. changes" \
-e "Numb. Tax. classes:" \
-e "Class. Taxonomy:" \
-e "Num. of queries:" \
-e "Aligned queries:" \
-e "Num. alignments:" \
-e "MinSupport set to:" \
04-analysis/screening/malt/refseq_bacarchhomo_gcs_20181122/*log | cut -d":" -f 2-99 > 00-documentation.backup/99-maltAlignedReadsSummary_raw_refseq_bacarchhomo_gcs_20181122_$(date "+%Y%m%d").txt
```

The corresponding `.megan`, `.nwk`  and OTU tables at various taxonomic
levels (as exported by MEGAN) can be seen in `06-additional_data_files` under
Data R11.

> [To jump back to table of contents press :top:](#table-of-contents)

### R12.6 Running AADDER

Then we ran AADDER

```bash
aadder-run \
-i 04-analysis/screening/aadder/input/*.sam.gz \
-d 01-data/databases/aadder/ \
-o 04-analysis/screening/aadder/output/ \
-v
pigz -p 112 04-analysis/screening/aadder/output/*
```

> :warning: AADDERR output files are not provided here due to large size

Finally we ran blast2rma to make the SAM files loadable into MEGAN

```bash
blast2rma \
--format SAM \
-i 04-analysis/screening/aadder/output/*out.gz \
-o 04-analysis/screening/aadder/rma6_2/ \
-a2seed 01-data/databases/acc2seed/acc2seed-May2015XX.abin \
-a2t 01-data/databases/acc2tax/nucl_acc2tax-Nov2018.abin \
-v
```

Once completed, the resulting RMA6 files were opened in MEGAN6CE (v6.15.2) via
MEGAN SERVER, opened in compare mode using absolute counts and 'ignore all
unassigned reads'. I then switched to the 'SEED' categories, 'uncollapse-all',
selected everything, then exported the table as TSV with seedPath_to_count. An
additional file that also included all unassigned reads was also exported (with
the same name but ending in `_summarised_Not_Assigned.txt)`, to allow comparison
between the host genera, the percent of reads that could be assigned functions.

After performing PCA on the protein-level SEED assignments, we wanted to explore
the contribution of each microbial species to the proteins with strongest
loadings in PC1 and PC2, to see if they differed between host genera. To do
this, we opened all of the AADDER .rma6 files from each host genera in MEGAN as
a group (all *Homo* at once, only ancient *Homo* all at once, all *Gorilla* at
once, etc.). From the SEED categories, each protein in the top 10 PC1 and PC2
positive and negative loadings were individually selected, and exported to a new
document. The new document summed the total read counts from all host samples
for each microbial species, so the individual read counts per species per sample
was lost. The species list and read count for ech host genus was exported from
MEGAN as a tsv (and stored in `04-analysis/screening/aadder/tables/`).

We manually added an additional 6 columns with a text editor Find and Replace
function: Host_Genus, Protein, PC1 code, PC2 code, PC1nomodcode, and
PC2nomodcode. The PC\<number\>code columns indicate the order of proteins from
strongest loading (1) to lowest loading (10) of the top 10 strongest loadings
in PC1 and PC2, for positive values and negative values. The
PC\<number\>nomodcode columns indicate the same loading order, but for the PCAs
that excluded modern *Homo* samples. For example, pc1n3 is the protein with
the 3rd strongest negative loading in PC1, and pc1p3 is the protein with the
3rd strongest positive loading in PC1. These codes were used to make the
protein names manageable and consistent in R, which had trouble with the
special characters in several protein names.

All analysis of AADDER functional profiles can be found in the R markdown
document here `02-scripts.backup/148-imv-aadder_evolution_function_cleaned.Rmd`.

The differences in the number of read assignments to any SEED category, and
specifically to the SEED Carbohydrate category, between sample groups were
explored.

We looked at whether specific species contributed the proteins with strongest
loadings in the biplots above to look for host-specific microbial species
contributions to proteins. First we looked at the proteins in strongest
negative loadings in PC1.

Lastly, we looked at whether proteins in specific metabolic pathways were
as distinct between host groups as all proteins combined, by performing
and plotting PCAs with proteins from only the Carbohydrate, Amino acid,
and Fatty acid metabolic pathways independently.

**Figure R61 | PCAs using SEED-classified proteins belonging to specific metabolic pathway categories.** Proteins in pathways that process major biomolecules do not each separate samples by host genus in a pattern similar to that seen in taxonomy, and all proteins. **a** Only proteins in the Carbohydrates category separate the samples by host genera in a pattern similar to that seen for taxonomy and all proteins. **b** Amino acid category proteins do not separate samples by host genera as distinctly as Carbohydrate category proteins. **c** Proteins in the Fatty acids, Lipids, and Isoprenoids category do not separate samples by host genera as distinctly as Carbohydrate category proteins.

### R12.7 Overlap between HUMAnN2 and AADDER

Finally, we wanted to see how many genes identified in the samples were
identified by both HUMAnN2 and AADDER, within major biomolecule processing
pathways (Amino acids, Carbohydrates, Fatty acids/Lipids).

Both the HUMAnN2 KEGG orthologs and the AADDER SEED proteins include the
Enzyme Commission number (EC number) on a majority of the orthologs/proteins
they report, so we compared the EC numbers between the two programs.

For HUMAnN2, all orthologs that are included in the KEGG Metabolism Pathways
'Amino acid', 'Carbohydrate', and 'Lipid' were individually selected out of the
full HUMAnN2 ortholog list. For AADDER, all proteins in the pathways
Amino Acids, Carbohydrates, and Fatty Acids, Lipids, and Isoprenoids were
selected out of the full AADDER table. All analyses based on EC numbers can be
found in the R markdown document here
`02-scripts.backup/149-imv-aa-carbs-lipids_kegg-vs-seed.Rmd`.
